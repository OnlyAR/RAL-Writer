  "structural_section_definition_and_function": [
    "Which survey has an introduction that clearly defines the research problem, its significance, and sets the stage for the entire study, making it easy to understand the purpose behind the subsequent sections?",
    "In terms of the methods section, which survey concisely and brilliantly describes the core steps of each method? 'concisely' means presenting the information in a brief and to-the-point manner. And 'brilliantly' implies that the description is not only clear but also effectively conveys the significance and unique aspects of each step.",
    "Which survey's discussion section effectively interprets the results, relates them back to the initial research questions, and also discusses the implications of the findings in a structured manner?",
    "Is the conclusion section of the survey concise yet comprehensive, summarizing the main points from all previous sections and leaving a clear take-away message? Which one achieves this better?",
    "Which survey uses sub-sections within the main sections (e.g., sub-sections in the methods for different data sources) to further organize the content and enhance readability?"
  ],
  "structural_logical_flow_within_sections": [
    "In the introduction, which survey presents the background information in a logical order, leading step by step to the formulation of the research questions?",
    "Does the results section present the data in a logical progression, perhaps starting with general findings and then moving to more specific details? Which one does this more effectively?",
    "In the discussion section, which survey's analysis of the results follows a logical train of thought, for example, first discussing the expected results and then moving on to the unexpected ones?",
    "Which survey uses transitional sentences or paragraphs within each section to ensure a smooth flow between different ideas or sub - topics?",
    "When presenting complex information in any section, which survey breaks it down into smaller, more digestible parts and arranges them in a logical sequence?"
  ],
  "structural_coherence_between_sections": [
    "Which survey creates a seamless transition from the introduction to the methods section, clearly showing how the research questions led to the choice of research methods?",
    "How does each survey connect the results to the discussion section? Which one effectively uses the results as a basis for interpreting the significance of the research?",
    "Which survey ensures that the conclusion follows logically from the entire study, summarizing the key points from all previous sections and not introducing new, unrelated information?",
    "When presenting multiple sub-studies or datasets within the survey, which one manages to integrate them into a coherent whole, showing how they all contribute to the overall research goal?",
    "Which survey can maintain a consistent focus throughout all sections, ensuring that every part of the study is relevant to the central research problem?"
  ],
  "structural_use_of_signposting_and_signals": [
    "Which survey uses headings and sub-headings effectively to signal the different parts of the study and help the reader navigate through the content?",
    "Does the survey use topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to clearly indicate what the paragraph will be about? Which one does this more consistently?",
    "Which survey uses reasonable transitional words and phrases (e.g., 'however', 'therefore', 'in addition') to show the relationships between different ideas, both within and between sections?",
    "When presenting a complex argument or analysis, which survey uses numbered lists or bullet points to break it down and make the structure more visible?",
    "Which survey uses signposting statements in the introduction to preview the main sections of the study and their order, helping the reader anticipate what's to come?"
  ],
  "structural_avoidance_of_flaws": [
    "Which survey manages to avoid having sections that seem out of place or unrelated to the overall study, maintaining a tight and focused structure?",
    "Does the survey avoid repeating information across different sections? Which one is more successful in presenting each piece of information only once, or cross-referencing it effectively if necessary?",
    "When presenting multiple perspectives or viewpoints, which survey avoids creating a muddled structure and instead presents them in a clear, organized way?",
    "Which survey does not have a structure that is too rigid or formulaic, but still allows for flexibility in presenting the research in an engaging manner?",
    "Does the survey avoid having a disjointed structure where the flow of ideas is disrupted? Which one maintains a smooth and continuous narrative throughout the study?"
