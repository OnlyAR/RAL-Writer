    "In the context of a survey generation task, which response can most accurately quote the experimental results from a research paper? This means presenting the results without any bias. Additionally, how can it explain these results within the backdrop of the study? A proper 'contextual explanation' should clarify the results' role and importance in the overall research framework.",
    "In a survey generation task, which survey can conduct a more comprehensive and profound analysis of the trends and patterns in the data? 'Comprehensive analysis' involves observing trends from multiple dimensions, and 'in - depth analysis' requires delving into the underlying reasons behind these trends.",
    "When performing a survey generation task, which survey can better elucidate the impact of the data on broader research fields? 'Broader research fields' include multiple disciplines or directions related to the current research, and 'impact' covers both theoretical and practical aspects.",
    "In the process of survey generation, which survey can more clearly establish a connection between the data and theoretical frameworks or models? 'Connection' means explaining how the data supports or validates the theoretical frameworks and how these frameworks interpret the data.",
    "When working on a survey generation project, which answer can better emphasize the crucial relationship between the data and the research question? A'significant relationship' is defined by how the data directly or indirectly aids in resolving the research question.",
    "In the process of survey generation, which survey can more clearly highlight the gaps or missing elements in the data? 'Gaps' refer to the differences between the data and the ideal state, and'missing elements' refer to the necessary data for research that has not been obtained."
