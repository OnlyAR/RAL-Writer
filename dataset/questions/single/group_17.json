        "question": "What are the key performance metrics and numerical results obtained by the Pareto MTL algorithm in the Multi-Fashion-MNIST experiment?",
        "answer": "In the Multi-Fashion-MNIST experiment, the Pareto MTL algorithm demonstrates the ability to generate multiple well-distributed Pareto solutions that outperform other methods. Specifically, Pareto MTL provides solutions that are compatible with the strong single-task baseline with different trade-offs among tasks. The results confirm that it can successfully provide a set of well-representative Pareto solutions for the MTL problem across various distributions of task relations.",

        "answer": "In the self-driving car localization task, Pareto MTL achieves a translation error of 7.285 meters and a rotation error of 2.335 degrees when prioritizing translation, and a translation error of 8.411 meters and a rotation error of 1.771 degrees when prioritizing rotation. This outperforms other methods in providing solutions with different trade-offs, performing notably better in rotation error when rotation is prioritized, and offering competitive translation error.",

A t-test was chosen because the distribution of mean HVs was approximately normal. The network initializations were different in each run. The hypervolume was observed to be maximal for our proposed HV maximization-based approach indicating that the Pareto fronts approximations on validation samples were closer to the Pareto front when using the HV maximization approach.\\\""
