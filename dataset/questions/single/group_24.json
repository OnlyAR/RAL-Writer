        "question": "What are the key differences in regularization strength across the different loss function variants in GPO?",
        "answer": "In the empirical experiments conducted in the GPO paper, different loss function variants exhibited different regularization strengths as a function of the hyperparameter \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Specifically, the squared loss and truncated squared loss tended to enforce stronger regularization than other variants like logistic, exponential, and Savage losses. This was evidenced by the behavior of the median KL divergence, which showed that under large values of \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), these losses resulted in smaller KL divergence compared to others.",

        "answer": "According to the experimental results in the GPO paper, there is no significant difference in the peak performance across various GPO variants when the optimal \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) selection is made for each. The peak performance was generally similar across different variants, indicating that the choice of \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) and the training step were more critical factors than the specific loss function variant employed.",
