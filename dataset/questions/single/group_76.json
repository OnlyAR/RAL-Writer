        "answer": "In the low-resource scenarios for the CoNLL04 dataset, the TANL model outperforms the baseline model SpERT, with performance maintained under smaller training set sizes from only 0.8% to 6% of the full training data. The performance comparison shows that while the full training set performance is similar between TANL and SpERT, TANL showcases superior efficiency and effectiveness in low-resource settings.",
