        "answer": "The Nopol approach successfully fixes 17 out of 22 real-world bugs, which include 13 out of 16 bugs with buggy if conditions and 4 out of 6 bugs with missing preconditions. The approach is shown to be effective on real-world projects such as Apache Commons Math and Apache Commons Lang.",
