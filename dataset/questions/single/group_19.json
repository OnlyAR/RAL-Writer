For example, UVCOM shows an average mAP of 49.04 for middle-length moments (10–30 seconds), but only 12.65 for short moments (less than 10 seconds), revealing a substantial gap. This indicates that short moments exhibit relatively simple and less diverse feature distributions, leading to a drop in performance.",
