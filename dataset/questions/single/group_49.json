The CSI500 had 3159 samples and 500 nodes, divided into 2677 training, 239 validation, and 243 test samples. The CSI1000 had the same number of samples but 1000 nodes. The NASDAQ dataset had 1225 samples and 1026 nodes, divided into 738 training, 253 validation, and 234 test samples. Similarly, the NYSE dataset had 1225 samples and 1737 nodes, with the same partitioning as NASDAQ.",
