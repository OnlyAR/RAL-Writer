        "answer": "The initial balance graph in the simulation was created by taking a recent snapshot from the channel graph of the Lightning Network and splitting the channel capacity into two balance values uniformly at random independently for each channel. In the simulation, a medium-sized Lightning node with a local balance of 0.42 BTC was able to send 0.4 BTC to another node 3 hops distant in just 4 rounds, with a total fee of 814 sat. This was achieved despite only $75\\\\%$ of the amount being successfully sent in the first round.",
