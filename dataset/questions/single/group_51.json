        "question": "What are the accuracy results of the Reformer model with different numbers of LSH hashes on the synthetic sequence duplication task?",
        "answer": "On the synthetic task, a model trained with full attention achieves 100% accuracy, while a model trained with LSH attention using 4 hashes also achieves nearly perfect performance. As the number of hashes decreases (e.g., to 2 or 1), the accuracy declines significantly. The model trained with LSH-$4$ achieves 100% accuracy when evaluated with LSH-$4$ and 99.9% with 8 hashes.",

        "answer": "On the ETTh_1 dataset with a prediction horizon of 168, the Informer model achieves a MSE of 0.183 and a MAE of 0.346, which significantly outperforms the LSTMa model, which has a MSE of 0.236 and a MAE of 0.392. This indicates that the Informer model has better performance for long sequence time-series forecasting compared to LSTMa for this given horizon.",
