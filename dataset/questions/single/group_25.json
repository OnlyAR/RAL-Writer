        "question": "What are the findings regarding the correlation between entity degree and predicted score in the context of gene-disease association predictions presented in the paper \\\"Implications of Topological Imbalance for Representation Learning on Biomedical Knowledge Graphs\\\"?",
        "answer": "The paper finds a clear relationship between the degree of an entity and the score assigned to it when predicting gene-disease associations. Higher-degree entities receive higher scores, indicating a bias towards highly-connected genes irrespective of the dataset or model used. This pattern was consistent across all 137 diseases in Hetionet.",
        "reference": "The paper \\\"Implications of Topological Imbalance for Representation Learning on Biomedical Knowledge Graphs\\\" discusses this in Section \\\"Correlation with Topological Structure\\\": \\\"The figures show there is a very clear relationship between the degree of the entity and the score assigned to it by the model â€“ the higher the degree, the more likely the model considers the entity to complete the triple. This observation holds for both well-connected ... and sparsely connected diseases.\\\""
