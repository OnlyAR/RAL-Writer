        "answer": "\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nScoreGrad employs continuous energy-based generative models for forecasting tasks, focusing on transforming and evaluating model states across multiple datasets without specific emphasis on spatial components. Meanwhile, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDiffSTG integrates denoising diffusion models explicitly with spatio-temporal graphs (STG), leveraging graph neural networks to model spatial correlations, thus targeting spatio-temporal forecasting needs.",

In contrast, Generative Time Series Forecasting uses a 3% slice of the Electricity dataset's full set to assess generative performance improvements without presenting spatial context coverage specified in DiffSTG. This points out more comprehensive spatial sampling in DiffSTG.",
