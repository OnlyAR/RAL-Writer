        "question": "How does the model size of SimDA compare to other state-of-the-art Text-to-Video generation methods like Video LDM and VideoComposer in terms of parameters and efficiency?",
        "answer": "The SimDA framework has a total of 1.08 billion parameters, which is significantly smaller compared to other state-of-the-art Text-to-Video methods. For example, Video LDM has 4.20 billion parameters while VideoComposer has 1.85 billion. Additionally, SimDA is noted for being more parameter-efficient, as it fine-tunes only 0.025 billion of these parameters, compared to the larger numbers of parameters being fine-tuned in other methods.",

        "answer": "SimDA has a CLIPSIM score of 0.2945 on the MSR-VTT dataset, which is higher than the CLIPSIM score of 0.2631 achieved by CogVideo. This implies that SimDA demonstrates better text-video similarity performance, meaning it is better at aligning generated videos with the textual descriptions provided as input.",
