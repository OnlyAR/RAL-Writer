        "question": "In terms of evaluating privacy risks for generated EHR data, how does the approach in 'EHR Diff' compare to CEHR-GPT in terms of membership inference and attribute inference attacks?",
        "answer": "For 'EHR Diff', membership inference risk is approximately 0.2956, whereas for CEHR-GPT it is calculated at 0.1266. In terms of attribute inference risk, 'EHR Diff' has a score of 0.0190, while CEHR-GPT reported a slightly higher F1 score for synthetic vs real data at 0.0271. Thus, CEHR-GPT exhibits lower privacy breaches for membership inference but slightly higher for attribute inference, compared to EHR Diff.",

        "answer": "CEHR-GPT incorporates detailed temporal tokens and structures into its representation to maintain accurate timelines across patient history, essential for predicting medical events relative to time. It uses time tokens extensively to determine gaps between patient encounters. HALO, however, utilizes a high-dimensional approach capturing multiple detailed features via binary sequences over a million variables but doesn't explicitly focus on maintaining time-series data in its dimensional reduction process.",

CEHR-GPT achieved the closest KL divergence with top_p=95\\\\\\\\% and top_k=300 sampling, while HALO obtained up to 0.914 $R^2$ on unigram code probabilities, showing strong performance but in a different metric.",

HALO, on the other hand, evaluates dimension-wise prediction using classification tasks like logistic regression using synthetic data to achieve high mean accuracies such as 0.879 on average across labels, indicating comprehensive feature interaction modeling.

        "answer": "HALO conducts synthetic data generation over a broader feature set reaching over a million binary sequence variables by hierarchically modeling across visits and codes, focusing on qualitative and quantitative expansion without loss. CEHR-GPT innovates on sampling methods for new sequence creation, maintaining approximately 98\\\\textpercent of generated sequences that match OMOP without errors, thereby preserving critical temporal features. This indicates HALO's emphasis on dimension expansion, while CEHR-GPT sustains feature fidelity within a controlled broader representation format.",
