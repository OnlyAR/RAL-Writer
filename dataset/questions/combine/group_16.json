        "answer": "In 'Modeling Relational Data with Graph Convolutional Networks,' the model uses negative sampling strategies for link prediction tasks, with a specific example given for DistMult that samples negatives by corrupting either the subject or object of positive examples. Conversely, 'Heterogeneous Graph Transformer' introduces the 'HGSampling' algorithm specifically designed for heterogeneous graphs. This algorithm aims to balance node types during sampling and reduce subgraph sparsity, making it suitable for web-scale graphs.",

        "answer": "'GFS: Graph-based Feature Synthesis for Prediction over Relational Databases' considers databases like the Outbrain dataset, which contains 9 tables and a total of 28 million rows (nodes). In contrast, 'Modeling Relational Data with Graph Convolutional Networks' works with datasets like FB15k, which has 14,951 entity nodes and 1,345 relation types, and handles dense relational connectivity typical of knowledge graphs. Thus, the scalability considerations in 'GFS' are directed more towards inter-table relationships across less densely connected schemas compared to well-linked graphs in 'Modeling Relational Data with Graph Convolutional Networks.'",
