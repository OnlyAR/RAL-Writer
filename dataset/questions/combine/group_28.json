        "answer": "In \\\\\\\"Visual Autoregressive Modeling: Scalable Image Generation via Next-Scale Prediction,\\\\\\\" the VAR framework exhibits a power-law scaling behavior with the model size and optimal compute, where increasing the model parameters or computation consistently improves performance metrics like FID. This scaling shows a strong linear relationship between the logarithm of model size or compute and the logarithm of the test loss, with Pearson coefficients nearing -0.998, indicating robust scalability. On the other hand, in \\\\\\\"Computational Tradeoffs in Image Synthesis: Diffusion, Masked-Token, and Next-Token Prediction,\\\\\\\" scaling trends indicate that the next-token prediction initially outperforms diffusion models in terms of FID at smaller compute budgets, but scaling trends also suggest it is eventually matched by diffusion models as compute is increased. Both studies indicate that larger models and more compute contribute to better performance, but the VAR demonstrates a more predictable scaling in terms of FID metrics.",

        "answer": "VAR modeling reported in 'Visual Autoregressive Modeling: Scalable Image Generation via Next-Scale Prediction' achieves inference speed approximately 20 times faster compared to some baseline AR models, emphasizing optimized parallel generation at reduced complexity. 'Computational Tradeoffs in Image Synthesis: Diffusion, Masked-Token, and Next-Token Prediction' claims next-token prediction is highly efficient in inference as it requires less compute than diffusion, because sequential generation processes can use key-value caching. The masked token prediction is less compute efficient, as stated, due to the iterative nature, showing how next-token prediction was highlighted as the leading efficient model when considering inference computational needs.",
