        "question": "How does the dataset size used for fine-tuning affect the performance of models across the papers \\\\\\\"Self-Alignment with Instruction Backtranslation\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Kun: Answer Polishment for Chinese Self-Alignment with Instruction Back-Translation\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"Better Alignment with Instruction Back-and-Forth Translation\\\\\\\"?",
        "answer": "In the paper \\\\\\\"Self-Alignment with Instruction Backtranslation\\\\\\\", the dataset size varied for different methods but primarily emphasized high-quality data selection. The augmented data used ranges from 41.8K for the highest quality data to a total of 512K for all augmented examples. The best performance was on the largest dataset after filtering and rewriting (51.2K), achieving a win rate of 91.74% with Llama-2-70B.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn \\\\\\\"Kun: Answer Polishment for Chinese Self-Alignment with Instruction Back-Translation\\\\\\\", dataset sizes such as 9k, 26k, 39k, 52k, 100k, 200k, and 360k are mentioned. The Kun-360k model was among the top-end models with a win rate suggesting significant instruction data size yields improved performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn \\\\\\\"Better Alignment with Instruction Back-and-Forth Translation\\\\\\\", smaller to moderate datasets like Dolma + filtering with 12.8K yielded a win rate of 71.70% at the 7B scale. Larger datasets with rewriting improved the win rate substantially, indicating enhanced model performance with the increase in dataset size up to 51.2K, with a notable 91.74% win rate for rewritten data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThus, across the papers, models show improved performance metrics with increased high-quality dataset sizes, though the method of generating or curating this data also plays a significant role.",
