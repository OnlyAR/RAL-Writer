        "answer": "In terms of quantization performance at different bit levels:\\\\n- For GPTQ, during the evaluation of the LLaMA models at 4 bits, the perplexity on WikiText2 for LLaMA-2-13B was around 5.63.\\\\n- AWQ shows a similar performance, with 4-bit perplexity results for LLaMA-2-13B at 4.97.\\\\n- QQQ shows 5.01 perplexity for LLaMA-2-13B under 4-bit quantization.\\\\nThis highlights that all methods are fairly close in terms of performance maintaining at similar bit levels, with AWQ slightly outperforming the others in some scenarios and keeping balance between activation and weights.",

        "answer": "AWQ shows the least degradation in perplexity when moved to 4-bit quantization. Specifically, AWQ maintains a perplexity of 4.97 on LLaMA-2-13B, whereas GPTQ has a 4-bit perplexity of 5.63, and QQQ results in a perplexity of 5.01 on the same model.

        "answer": "Precision handling in terms of bit allocation:\\\\n- GPTQ primarily focuses on reducing weight precision to 3 or 4 bits while keeping activations in higher precision (such as FP16), thereby optimizing weight storage.\\\\n- AWQ emphasizes maintaining efficient low-bit weight quantization (like INT3) while recognizing vital activation alignment, leading to a mix-precision strategy mainly focused on weights.\\\\n- QQQ operates with W4A8 (Weights and Activations at 4 and 8 bits respectively), systematically addressing both weights and activations together with channel-wise control.\\\\nTherefore, QQQ takes a more generalized approach towards handling precision uniformly over weights and activations than GPTQ and AWQ.",

        "answer": "For LLaMA-7B:\\\\n- GPTQ utilizes a technique that significantly reduces the model size enabling higher efficiency but is primarily effective with higher parameter models due to its post-training nature.\\\\n- AWQ provides effective quantization even in smaller models like LLaMA-7B, achieving better generalization with moderate compression.\\\\n- QQQ shows a perplexity of 6.19 in its W4A8 configuration for LLaMA-1-7B, marginally higher than larger models but implements adaptive smoothing and Hessian-based compensation which improve performance over earlier approaches.\\\\nTherefore, AWQ generally maintains higher effective accuracy for smaller models like LLaMA-7B compared to QQQ, with GPTQ favoring larger model scaling.",
