        "question": "In the MLLM-as-a-Judge paper, six different MLLMs were evaluated for their performance on various tasks. How does their performance compare to the ReFT paper's evaluations of CodeLLAMA and Galactica in terms of generalization ability in tasks like GSM8K and other benchmarks?",
        "answer": "In the MLLM-as-a-Judge paper, models like GPT-4V consistently showed better human alignment across tasks compared to other MLLMs such as Gemini, Qwen-VL-Max, etc. In contrast, the ReFT paper shows significant improvement in the reasoning abilities of Galactica and CodeLLAMA models on tasks like GSM8K with ReFT outperforming traditional SFT by 6.7 to 7.4 percentage points across models. While MLLM tasks involve multimodal judgments, ReFT evaluations are more text-centric, showing increased accuracy in math reasoning tasks.",

        "answer": "The \\\"ReFT: Reasoning with Reinforced Fine-Tuning\\\" paper evaluates models using primarily math-focused datasets like GSM8K, MathQA, and SVAMP, with emphasis on reasoning tasks using numeric and multiple-choice question formats. It leverages reinforcement learning techniques to improve LLMs using a modest volume of datasets focusing on CoT reasoning. In contrast, \\\"MLLM-as-a-Judge\\\" employs a vastly diverse set of datasets across modalities, including image captioning and multimodal reasoning, involving 14 datasets covering over 4,414 image-instruction pairs for assessing MLLM judgment capabilities. This paper focuses on different modalities and evaluates based on human alignment across a multitude of tasks, making the volume and diversity significantly greater than in the ReFT paper.",

On the other hand, \\\"ReFT\\\" reports substantial improvements over SFT in GSM8K and SVAMP datasets, with around a 10-point improvement in accuracy using CodeLLAMA after applying ReFT methods. Both papers show significant improvements in their respective domains but focus on different aspects, with Auto-CoT highlighting question diversity for reasoning tasks and ReFT focusing on reinforced learning strategies in math reasoning.",

        "answer": "The \\\"MLLM-as-a-Judge\\\" paper primarily evaluates variation in judgments across modalities, reporting an average similarity score of 0.490 with human judgment for GPT-4V on all tasks, indicating a close alignment with human preferences. In contrast, the \\\"ReFT\\\" paper shows numerical improvements with a reported up to 10-point increase over SFT in reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K, measuring numeric accuracy improvements rather than judgment alignments. This demonstrates that while MLLM testing focuses on human preference alignment in various multimodal tasks, ReFT emphasizes accuracy improvements in logical reasoning tasks.",

On the other hand, \\\"MLLM-as-a-Judge\\\" evaluates much broader multimodal diversity with 14 datasets to test judgment capabilities, achieving an average Pearson similarity of 0.490 in scoring tasks with its top models like GPT-4V. Both use diverse datasets for evaluation but focus on different performance criteria: numerical accuracies for specific reasoning tasks in CoT and judgment alignment in varied multimodal tasks in MLLM.",

In contrast, \\\"MLLM-as-a-Judge\\\" covers 14 datasets across multiple modalities including image captioning and infographics, reflecting a broad diversity aimed at evaluating MLLMsâ€™ alignment with human judgments; an average score similarity of around 0.490 indicates broader, less numerically grounded improvement across varied cognitive tasks rather than logical reasoning accuracy.",
