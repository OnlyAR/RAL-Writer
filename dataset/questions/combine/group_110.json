        "answer": "DeLighT focuses on exploiting model structure to improve performance with substantially fewer parameters by focusing on machine translation and language modeling tasks, leveraging dataset-specific structure and variations to make efficient models. Conversely, FLAN finetunes a sizeable pre-trained language model using diverse templates across 62 datasets grouped into 12 task clusters, wisely using variety to improve zero-shot performance. FLAN draws potency from task variety, as verified by strong performance on unseen tasks, showing a broad application spectrum enhanced by dataset variety. DeLighT's strategy showcases advantages in efficient parameter allocation and achieving high performance on certain tasks like machine translation, typically suitable for hardware or computational limits.",

        "answer": "FLAN, as evaluated on translation benchmarks like French-English and German-English, shows strong zero-shot translation results into English but is generally weaker when translating from English, consistent with its primary English pretraining data coverage. On the WMT'14 and WMT'16 datasets, FLAN improves over zero-shot GPT-3, indicating efficiency in translation tasks with instruction tuning. DeLighT, however, focuses more on efficient architecture rather than specific language coverage. While its language capabilities per se weren’t highlighted, the DeLighT architecture might imply substantial improvements especially for computational efficiency, not quite challenging language coverage as FLAN does with specific task-context tuning.",

        "answer": "FLAN uses instruction tuning across over 60 datasets split into task clusters to improve zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, capitalizing on task diversity to enhance model adaptability across various tasks. This approach allows FLAN to perform significantly better on unseen tasks compared to non-instruction-tuned models. DeLighT, on the other hand, focuses on efficiency in parameter usage and is applied more specifically to achieve performance gains with fewer parameters, rather than explicitly exploiting dataset variety. The empirical advantage for FLAN is reflected in improvements across multiple unseen benchmark evaluations; DeLighT gains are more pronounced in the efficiency of machine translation tasks.",

        "answer": "DeLighT achieves computational efficiency by creating models with 2.5 to 4 times the depth of standard transformers but with fewer parameters, enhancing hardware efficiency, especially in machine translation tasks where it logs better BLEU scores with fewer computational resources. On the other hand, FLAN doesn’t primarily aim for computational efficiency, but improves zero-shot performance on unseen tasks by leveraging a large pre-trained model of 137B parameters, emphasizing performance enhancements via instruction-tuning across diverse datasets, requiring comparatively higher computational resources.",

        "answer": "DeLighT Transformer significantly reduces the number of parameters required by achieving similar or better performance in machine translation tasks with up to 2.8 times fewer parameters than standard transformers. RAdam, as evaluated, provides training stability by using a variance-based fixed warmup schedule equivalent to linear warmup schedules over $2 \\\\times (1 - \\\\beta_2)^{-1}$ iterations, with empirical studies showing little to no difference in final performance when compared to untuned linear warmup. While RAdam's focus is on stability without tuning warmup schedules, the quantitative parameter efficiency gain in DeLighT is distinct with clear improvements using fewer parameters, which isn't a focus for RAdam which maintains similar calculations to existing processes without reducing parameter usage.",

        "answer": "DeLighT engages in varying training lengths depending on dataset size, such as training for 100K iterations for language modeling tasks. The RAdam optimization process involves particular focus during the early stages, recommending a fixed warmup equivalent to 4 initial iterations of heavy-ball momentum and continuing with Adam with a fixed warmup schedule for at least 40 iterations to mitigate early training instability. While DeLighT's iterations concern achieving optimal efficiency through efficient depth and diminished parameters, RAdam adopts an approach centered on ensuring early-stage stability mainly over initial 44 or more iterations, focusing on stability rather than model architectural efficiency.",
