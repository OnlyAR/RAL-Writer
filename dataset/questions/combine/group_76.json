        "answer": "Entity-to-Text based data augmentation, specifically through models like CLARE, achieves competitive performance gains but focuses primarily on NER tasks, whereas KnowCoder shows a strong generalization ability across multiple Information Extraction (IE) tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), and Event Extraction (EE), demonstrating improvements in F1 scores up to 21.9% in low-resource settings across these tasks compared to baseline UIE models.",

        "answer": "The KnowCoder framework utilizes a highly extensive schema library covering over 30,000 types of knowledge, and it is trained on billions of automatically constructed training data samples. TANL achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets with a more task-specific selection focused on few-shot relation classification and NER tasks, exemplified by the use of specific datasets like CoNLL04 and CoNLL05 for various structure predictions. KnowCoder shows improvements up to 21.9% in low resource settings due to this extensive training while TANLâ€™s focused datasets allow for detailed improvements on tasks like NER, achieving new state-of-the-art scores in specific tasks such as Those focused in the few-shot regime.",

        "answer": "KnowCoder improves performance via a two-phase training framework that leverages a large schema library for code-style schema representations, achieving significant generalization improvements (up to 49.8% in few-shot settings) through pretraining and instruction tuning across NER tasks. In contrast, Entity-to-Text based augmentation in NER focuses on enhancing data diversity and preserving entity coherence using generative models, targeting improved performance in specific NER tasks such as nested and flat NER, optimizing generation through techniques like diversity beam search.",

In comparison, the Entity-to-Text based augmentation approach shows improvements, e.g., 4.22% on CADEC, but does not reach the 21.9% improvement demonstrated by KnowCoder.

TANL's datasets are more task-specific and targeted, achieving state-of-the-art results on joint entity and relation extraction datasets like CoNLL04 and ACE2005 without such broad numerical classification within a universal schema.",
