        "answer": "For LLaMA-7B using LLM-Pruner, a 20% parameter reduction maintains 94.97% of the original model's accuracy after efficient post-training. In the Shortened LLaMA paper, under moderate pruning (20% pruned to achieve a 5.5B parameter model), the model achieves 63.5% average accuracy and a perplexity of 20.2 on WikiText2, indicating good performance recovery though using different measures than LLM-Pruner.",

        "answer": "LLM-Pruner on LLaMA-13B with 20% pruning resulted in average accuracy around 60.07% for zero-shot tasks. On the other hand, Shortened LLaMA, with a similar parameter pruning ratio on large models, demonstrated various retention scores depending on retraining techniques used. Combined CPT and LoRA on Vicuna-13B shows a higher average accuracy but the specific LLaMA-13B, at a ratio around 37% for those results, retaining about 80-90% of the performance yield higher scores.",

On the contrary, Shortened LLaMA, with a similar focus on depth pruning, leverages both LoRA and CPT retraining methods, achieving a higher overall performance retention across various tasks under a more significant parameter reduction rate (21% pruning:\\\\n with retention around 85.75%). Thus, Shortened LLaMA emphasizes aggressive retraining for better performance recovery, while LLM-Pruner manages compression without extensive retraining.",

ShortGPT, on the other hand, retains 86.31% performance with a larger parameter pruning ratio around 27.1% without any post-training, focusing more on strategic layer removal. Thus, while LLM-Pruner focuses on efficient post-training, ShortGPT demonstrates notable post-compression performance without it.",

Shortened LLaMA, focusing on depth pruning with aggressive techniques, produces efficient models that also enhance speed, especially when under memory constraints with a focal 20% reduction yielding significant latency improvement. Both methods enhance computational efficiency but emphasize redundancy differently.",

Conversely, LLM-Pruner focuses on retaining up to 94.97% of performance through LoRA post-training when applied to related scale models within a lesser parameter reduction, highlighting its different approach to functionality and precision during compression with structural pruning techniques.",
