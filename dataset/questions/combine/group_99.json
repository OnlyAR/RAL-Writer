Thus, OpenWebMath contains significantly more tokenized data than is explicitly quantified for \\\\textsc{NaturalProofs}.",

        "answer": "The OpenWebMath dataset consists of mathematical webpages extracted from Common Crawl, focusing on preserving mathematical notation, mostly sourced from forums, educational content, reference pages, scientific papers, and blogs. Meanwhile, \\\\textsc{NaturalProofs} is obtained from ProofWiki, the Stacks project, and textbooks, which provides data from collaborative platforms and formal educational content. OpenWebMath covers a more diverse range of web-scraped sources, while \\\\textsc{NaturalProofs} focuses more on structured sources like textbooks and specific online projects.",

In OpenWebMath, deduplication is achieved using SimHash, focusing on paragraph-level deduplication specific to Common Crawl documents. The approaches differ in the granularity and scope of deduplication applied in each dataset.",

OpenWebMath, on the other hand, focuses on extracting LaTeX from HTML utilizing custom pipelines to retain math notation from web-sourced content, managing 14.7 billion tokens primarily from webpages. MathPile uses processing tailored for academic papers, while OpenWebMath adapts to web environments to ensure LaTeX extraction.",
