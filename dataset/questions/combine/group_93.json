In contrast, the \\\"Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO)\\\" method typically started the optimization with around 3.5% of a relatively large dataset like GSM8K's training dataset (7,473 samples), implying the initial setup might leverage a larger pool for achieving effective results, though fewer are needed initially during active steps given the meta-prompt's reliance primarily on top 20 instructions iteratively.",
