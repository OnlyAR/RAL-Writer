        "answer": "The Reformer with LSH Attention has a memory complexity of O(bln_rc), with b as batch size, l as length, and n_r as the number of hash repetitions. Reformer can maintain efficiency even with long sequences due to reversible layers and chunking. The Autoformer, due to its Auto-Correlation mechanism, achieves approximately the same memory complexity of O(L log L) for length-L series, as it focuses on series-wise connections rather than point-wise, which reduces the need for extensive memory even with increasing sequence length. Both aim for efficient memory usage with long sequences, but through different mechanisms.",

        "answer": "The Reformer model's LSH Attention operates with a complexity of O(L log L), focusing on finding the nearest keys and reducing computation through hash bucketing. Meanwhile, the Informer's ProbSparse Attention also achieves a complexity of O(L log L) but through probabilistic sampling of attention queries. Both methods aim to reduce the quadratic complexity found in traditional Transformer models, specifically targeting long sequences by different approaches to sub-sampling keys and queries for efficiency.",

On the other hand, the Reformer is largely focused on efficiency and scalability with memory usage through LSH attention and reversible residual layers.
