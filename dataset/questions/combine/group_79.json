        "question": "How does the AliBi method's memory usage and speed compare with the KERPLE logarithmic variant across different datasets and sequence lengths?",
        "answer": "The ALiBi method is reported to use 11% less memory when training on shorter sequences, such as in the CC100+RoBERTa corpus experiment, while achieving faster training speeds compared to the sinusoidal baseline. In contrast, the KERPLE logarithmic variant is shown to be 9.7% faster than the T5 positional encoding but 3% slower than sinusoidal in training speed on the GitHub dataset. Specifically, ALiBi achieves strong speed and memory efficiency when training on short sequences, while KERPLE is slightly slower compared to sinusoidal but provides better extrapolation performance.",

        "answer": "The KERPLE logarithmic variant consistently achieves better extrapolation performance on the OpenWebText2 dataset as sequence lengths increase from 512 to 16,384. It starts with a perplexity of 23.9 at length 512 and maintains strong performance, achieving a perplexity of 21.4 at length 16,384, outperforming the AliBi method which has a perplexity of 22.5 at the same length.",

In the KERPLE experiments on the GitHub dataset, models are trained with a sequence length fixed at 512 tokens to analyze extrapolation abilities at sequence lengths beyond training data's length. Thus, Train Short, Test Long investigates a broader range of training lengths, while KERPLE focuses on one fixed short length to explore its extrapolation capability.",
