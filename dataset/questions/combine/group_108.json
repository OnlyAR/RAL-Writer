        "answer": "The 'TEVR' paper shows that using TEVR tokens results in a significant performance improvement, reducing WER from 10.10% to 3.64% on German CommonVoice 6.1 when using a 5-gram language model. In the 'VoxPopuli' paper, improvements are also observed through pre-training with unlabeled data, leading to a WER of 5.9% on a similar setting without domain specification.
