        "question": "How do the parameter sizes compare among EvoMoE, DS-MoE, and the traditional dense models mentioned in the papers?",
        "answer": "EvoMoE constructs its models with 16 experts per layer, creating models that have significantly larger parameter sizes due to expert inclusion but aims to keep inference FLOPs similar to dense models by activating a limited number of experts. DS-MoE, on the other hand, uses dense training and sparse inference to achieve comparable performance to dense models while activating 30-40% of parameters during inference. Dense models like Dense-6B used alongside DS-MoE have 6186M parameters, while DS-MoE-3B has 2846M parameters, indicating DS-MoE's reduced active parameter utilization compared to dense models.",

        "answer": "In EvoMoE, BLEU scores are used to evaluate machine translation tasks, achieving scores like 29.6 for English-to-German. EvoMoE also uses perplexity for language modeling tasks, where it achieves 12.24. DS-MoE uses perplexity as well to evaluate language modeling performance, achieving a perplexity of 12.98 for Dense-6B. This indicates that both models use perplexity for language modeling, but evaluation contexts like machine translation using BLEU are specific to EvoMoE.",

        "question": "How do EvoMoE and DS-MoE differ in their architectural approach to handle sparse computation?",
        "answer": "EvoMoE uses a two-phase approach involving expert-diversify and gate-sparsify phases to evolve from dense training to sparse inference. It evolves computational efficiency gradually to improve performance. DS-MoE employs dense training and sparse inference directly, leveraging mutual information loss and dense computation during the training phase across all experts to allow for sparse computation during inference. This means DS-MoE focuses on full engagement of experts for enhanced training while EvoMoE adapts its computational model progressively.",

        "answer": "EvoMoE aims to maintain similar inference FLOPs as dense models by activating a limited number of experts, implying that efficiency is gained mainly through reduced active parameter engagement. DS-MoE explicitly measures inference speed, claiming that its DS-MoE-6B model runs up to 1.86 times faster than similar dense models due to reduced active parameters. Thus, while both aim for efficiency, DS-MoE provides quantifiable inference speed improvements over traditional dense models, highlighting a distinct advantage in terms of computational speedup.",

        "answer": "EvoMoE emphasizes convergence performance by using an expert-diversify and gate-sparsify phase in training, evolving efficient parameter utilization through robust phase combining mechanisms. DS-MoE employs mutual information loss ensuring expert load balance during dense training which provides coverage efficiency across dense model parameters. MoLE, in contrast, targets optimized LoRA composition using hierarchical control via gating functions, focusing learning on effective composition and domain-specific gains, implying a unique focus on network structural efficiency rather than strictly model parameters across training.",

        "answer": "EvoMoE increases model scaling by incrementally adding and training diverse experts while adjusting the MoE gate from dense to sparse learning, and exposes ability to expertly expand with improved scalability with model increment. DS-MoE offers scalable inference by densely training across experts, ensuring scalable inference feature via sparse operations based on mutual information optimization, which helps maintain efficiency with low active parameter loads. MoLE adapts scalable invocation across diverse LoRA experts using hierarchical composition technology, demonstrating promise in scaling over increased workloads without explicitly quantified inference efficiency, often benefiting scalability by including new trained patterns. Thus, scalable efficiency varies with EvoMoE focusing on retainment of performance during scaling up and DS-MoE optimizing computational activation for scaling depth.",
