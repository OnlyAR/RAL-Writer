\begin{abstract}
This paper focuses on jailbreaking attacks against multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), seeking to elicit MLLMs to generate objectionable responses to harmful user queries. 
A maximum likelihood-based algorithm is proposed to find an \emph{image Jailbreaking Prompt} (imgJP), enabling jailbreaks against MLLMs across multiple unseen prompts and images (\emph{i.e.}, data-universal property). Our approach exhibits strong model-transferability, as the generated imgJP can be transferred to jailbreak various models, including MiniGPT-v2, LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2, in a black-box manner. Moreover, we reveal a connection between MLLM-jailbreaks and LLM-jailbreaks. As a result, we introduce a construction-based method to harness our approach for LLM-jailbreaks, demonstrating greater efficiency than current state-of-the-art methods.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Recently, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT \cite{brown2020language}, Claude \cite{bai2022training}, and Bard \cite{thoppilan2022lamda, bard} have been widely deployed. These models exhibit advanced general abilities but also pose serious safety risks such as truthfulness, toxicity, and bias \cite{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts,perez2022red,sheng2019woman,abid2021persistent,carlini2021extracting}. To mitigate these risks, the AI alignment has gained broad attention \cite{ouyang2022training, bai2022constitutional, korbak2023pretraining}, which aims to make artificial general intelligence (AGI) aligned with human values and follow human intent. 
For instance, it requires preventing LLMs from generating objectionable responses to harmful queries posed by users. With some dedicated schemes such as reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) \cite{ziegler2019fine}, public chatbots will not generate obviously inappropriate content when asked directly. 

However, it has been demonstrated that a special attack, namely \emph{jailbreaking attack}, can bypass such alignment guardrails to elicit aligned LLMs generating objectionable content \cite{wei2023jailbroken}. For example, Andy Zou's
outstanding work \yrcite{zou2023universal} has found that a specific prompt suffix allows the jailbreaking of most popular LLMs. 

Spurred by the success of LLMs, there is a surge of interest in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that allow users to provide images that influence the generated text \cite{liu2023visual,instructblip,zhu2023minigpt, chen2023minigpt,alayrac2022flamingo,ye2023mplug, Qwen-VL,gpt4v}. For example, ChatGPT-4V \cite{gpt4v} has shown strong abilities on multi-modal tasks such as visual question answer (VQA) and image captaining. On the other hand, it is well known that vision models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks \cite{naseer2021improving, mahmood2021robustness, wei2022towards, fu2022patch}. As a result, due to containing vulnerable visual modules, we argue that MLLMs are easier to jailbroken and pose more severe safety risks than pure LLMs.

With a normal image as input, MiniGPT-v2 will refuse to answer the harmful request (\emph{e.g.}, replying `\emph{I'm sorry, I cannot fulfill your request}'). In contrast, with our generated \emph{imgJP}, MiniGPT-v2 responds to the harmful request.}
\label{fig1}
\vspace{-1.0em}
\end{figure}

This paper focuses on the jailbreaking attack against MLLMs. It is the natural extension of LLM-jailbreaks \cite{shin2020autoprompt,wen2023hard,guo2021gradient,carlini2023aligned,zou2023universal}. The typical LLM-jailbreaking methods attempt to find a specific text string, namely \emph{text Jailbreaking Prompt} (txtJP), so that, when appending the txtJP to a harmful request, we can elicit the LLM to generate objectionable responses. Inspired by that, we introduce MLLM-jailbreaks using a specific image, referred to as the \emph{image Jailbreaking Prompt} (imgJP), instead of relying on a text string. When inputting the image \emph{imgJP} into a MLLM, we can elicit it to generate objectionable responses to harmful user queries. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig1}, if we input a harmful request to MLLMs with a regular image, they will refuse to answer with outputs like `\emph{I'm sorry, I cannot fulfill your request}'. If we replace the regular image with our imgJP, we can bypass the alignment guardrails of MLLMs and elicit it to generate harmful content. 

To achieve this, we propose a maximum likelihood-based approach by modifying the objective function of adversarial attacks. Traditional adversarial attacks usually focus on image classification \cite{goodfellow2014explaining, madry2017towards, carlini2017towards}, whereas jailbreaks deal with a generative task. Thus, when given harmful requests, we attempt to maximize the likelihood of generating the corresponding target outputs. The target outputs typically commence with a positive affirmation, such as ``Sure, here is a (content of query)". The modified optimization problem can still be solved with any adversarial attack strategy, such as Projected Gradient Decent (PGD) \cite{madry2017towards}. %Beside that, there is another attacking scenario where an input image is given. In this case, we will add a perturbation, called \emph{deltaJP}, to the input image, and formulate MLLM-jailbreak as finding a deltaJP such that the perturbed image allows the generation of objectionable content. 

Our attack approach possesses a strong \emph{\textbf{data-universal property}}, which is desired in real-world jailbreaking applications. The data-universal has two dimensions. The first is the \emph{prompt-universal}: the imgJP generated for a few-shot prompts (harmful requests) can be utilized to jailbreak other unseen prompts. The second is \emph{image-universal}: we can identify a unique perturbation that, when added to any unseen input image, enables a successful jailbreak. Thus, our approach can find a \emph{universal} perturbation to jailbreak MLLMs across multiple unseen prompts and images. 

The efficiency of prior LLMs-jailbreaks is recognized to be relatively low, primarily attributed to the challenges of discrete optimization in finding txtJP. In contrast, our empirical study illustrates that MLLM-jailbreaks can be conducted much more efficiently, thanks to the continuous nature of our optimization problem. Besides, optimizing the imgJP across thousands of pixels provides significantly greater richness and flexibility compared to optimizing the txtJP across discrete and limited tokens. From another perspective, we conclude that aligning MLLMs is more challenging than aligning LLMs. %Therefore, we strongly emphasize the serious concerns about MLLMs alignment.

Moreover, we reveal a connection between MLLM- and LLM-jailbreaks. As MLLMs always contain a LLM inside (\emph{e.g.} a MiniGPT-4 contains a LLaMA2), 
finding an imgJP to jailbreak a MLLM implies that the \emph{features fed to the inside LLM} contribute to the jailbreaking. We refer to these features as the jailbreaking embedding (embJP). Therefore, if we could find a txtJP whose features are similar to embJP, it can highly likely jailbreak the corresponding LLM. 

According to the connection, we harness our MLLM-jailbreaking approach to achieve LLM-jailbreaks by converting an imgJP to a corresponding txtJP. It is called \textbf{\emph{Construction-based Attack} (CA)} since it involves constructing a MLLM from a LLM. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig3}, we begin by constructing a MLLM that encapsulates the target LLM. Subsequently, we execute MLLM-jailbreaks to acquire an imgJP, simultaneously recording the corresponding embJP. Afterward, the embJP undergoes a reversal process into a pool of txtJP in the text space through De-embedding and De-tokenizer operations. The resulting txtJP can be directly employed to jailbreak the target LLM. Our empirical study demonstrates that only a small pool of reversed txtJP can successfully jailbreak the target LLMs. This approach allows us to sidestep the inefficient discrete optimization involved in LLM-jailbreaks. In particular, we conducted a construction-based attack from MiniGPT-4(LLaMA2) to LLaMA2 \cite{touvron2023llama}. We can achieve $93\%$ ASR with only a pool of $20$ reversed txtJPs, which is much more efficient than the GCG \cite{zou2023universal} approach. 

\emph{\textbf{Model-transferability}} is another desirable property, particularly for black-box jailbreaks, \emph{i.e.}, even if the imgJP is learned on a surrogate model, it can be effectively utilized to attack target models whose architecture and parameters are unknown. We evaluate the model-transferability of our approach. We generate the imgJP with respect to MiniGPT-4 \cite{zhu2023minigpt} with Vicuna \cite{zheng2023judging} and LLaMA2. Subsequently, we transfer it to attack various other MLLMs, including MiniGPT-v2 \cite{chen2023minigpt}, LLaVA \cite{liu2023visual}, InstructBLIP \cite{instructblip}, mPLUG-Owl2 \cite{ye2023mplug}. Empirical studies illustrate that our approach exhibits notable transferability, \emph{e.g.,} we achieve a transferred ASR of $59\%$ on mPLUG-Owl2 and MiniGPT-v2, and $33\%$ and $28\%$ transferred ASR on InstructBLIP and LLaVA, respectively. %, ChatGPT-4V \cite{gpt4v}.

Overall, we summarize our contributions as follows.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:RelatedWork}
Before the advent of large language models, adversarial attacks garnered attention, focusing on studying the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) \cite{goodfellow2014explaining,madry2017towards,carlini2017towards}. With the rapid development of LLM, adversarial attacks have extended to a new dimension, \emph{i.e.,}  jailbreaking attack.

\noindent\textbf{Conventional Adversarial Attack}
Regarding conventional small DNNs, the adversarial attack aims to find adversarial samples that are intentionally crafted to mislead models’ predictions. For instance, for a NLP task of sentiment analysis, it tries to fool the classifier to regard a positive review as a negative one through word substitution or sentence paraphrase \cite{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts,perez2022red,sheng2019woman,abid2021persistent,carlini2021extracting}. For an image classification task, it attempts to fool the classifier and induce misclassification \cite{naseer2021improving, mahmood2021robustness, wei2022towards, fu2022patch}.  

Particularly for multi-modal models, adversarial attacks aim to make these models fail in performing their tasks. For instance, an attack on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) task attempts to generate an answer that is irrelevant to the question. Similarly, an attack on an image captioning task aims to produce an image description that is unrelated to the content of the image \cite{bailey2023image,carlini2023aligned}. Although these attacks can be conducted against large models, they are not the primary focus of this paper. %However, by modifying the objective function in our approach, we can also extend our method to conduct such attacks against MLLMs. 

\noindent\textbf{Jailbreaking Attack}
The second category aims at large language models (LLMs) with close relation to the research of AI alignment. AI alignment focuses on ``aligning'' LLMs to the human value, \emph{e.g.,} not generating harmful or objectionable responses to user queries. With some dedicated schemes such as reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) \cite{ziegler2019fine}, public chatbots will not generate certain obviously inappropriate content when asked directly. However, some recent work reveals that a number of “jailbreak” tricks exist. For example, carefully engineered prompts can result in aligned LLMs generating clearly objectionable content \cite{shin2020autoprompt,wen2023hard,guo2021gradient,zou2023universal}. There is limited research on MLLM-jailbreak~\cite{bailey2023image, carlini2023aligned,qi2023visual}, showing the potential of such an attack, but a comprehensive study for the data-universal and model-transferability is warranted.

\section{Our Approach}
\label{sec:approach}
There are two MLLM-jailbreaking scenarios. The easier one occurs when no input image is given, and we can use any image as the imgJP. The second scenario involves a provided input image, and we are restricted to finding an image perturbation, namely \emph{deltaJP}, so that the perturbed input image is regarded as the imgJP. In the first scenario, only the prompt-universal property is desired, while in the second scenario, both the prompt-universal and image-universal properties are desired. We will discuss them separately.

\subsection{imgJP-based Jailbreak}
When no input image is given, we can freely generate the imgJP without the constraint of similarity to a given image. Specifically, we formulate MLLM-jailbreak as directly finding an imgJP, denoted as $x_{jp}$, so that it allows the generation of objectionable content. 

To achieve this, we propose a maximum likelihood-based approach by modifying adversarial attack methods. The main difference between adversarial attacks and jailbreaks lies in their focus on a classification task and a generation task, respectively. Classification tasks typically involve generating a predictable output from a set of pre-defined classes, while generation tasks allow outputting anything as long as it is relevant to user queries. Thus, the objectives of adversarial attacks, such as misclassification, are no longer suitable for jailbreaking attacks. 

When faced with a harmful query, a LLM equipped with alignment guardrails will decline it, responding with answers like ``Sorry, I cannot fulfill your request". Thus, a common strategy in LLM-jailbreaks is to encourage the LLM to respond with a positive affirmation, for instance, ``Sure, here is a (content of query)". We incorporate this strategy in our MLLM-jailbreaking attack, utilizing it to modify the objective function of traditional adversarial attacks. 

\begin{figure}[bpt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{end2end.png}
\vspace{-2.0em}
\caption{The jailbreaks with imgJP. Given a harmful request, we attempt to maximize the likelihood of generating the corresponding target outputs. The target outputs typically commence with a positive affirmation, such as ``Sure, here is a (content of query)".}\label{fig2}
\vspace{-1.0em}
\end{figure}

Specifically, for each harmful request $q_i$, we provide a corresponding target answer $a_i$, creating a dataset of harmful behaviors $B=\{(q_i, a_i), i=0,...,N\}$. And then, we formulate MLLM-jailbreak as finding the $x_{jp}$ such that it encourages the MLLMs to generate the target answer $a_i$ when users input the harmful query $q_i$, as follows,
\begin{align}
    &\mathop{\max}_{x_{jp}} \sum_{i=0}^{M} log(p(a_i| q_i, x_{jp})) \label{eq:imgjp} \\
    &\text{s.t. }  x_{jp} \in [0,255]^d    \notag
\end{align}
where $p(a_i| q_i, x_{jp})$ is the likelihood for a MLLM generate $a_i$ when provided with image $x_{jp}$ and text question $q_i$. Note that the optimal imgJP $ x_{jp}^*$ is optimized over $M$ query-answer pairs $\{(q_i, a_i), i=0,...,M\}$. This optimization problem can be solved using any adversarial attack methods, such as Projected Gradient Decent (PGD) \cite{madry2017towards}. 

As shown in Appendix, the jailbreaking ASR consistently improves with the increasing likelihood values, justifying that encouraging the MLLM to respond with a positive affirmation is an effective strategy for jailbreaking.

\vspace{-2.0em}
\caption{The pipeline of our construction-based attack. We harness our MLLM-jailbreaking approach to achieve LLM-jailbreaks by converting an imgJP to a corresponding txtJP.}\label{fig3}
\end{figure*}

Prompt-universal is a highly desired property in real-world applications. It implies that the imgJP $x_{jp}^*$ generated over a few-shot $M$ prompts $B_{train}=\{(q_i, a_i), i=0,...,M\}$ can be effectively utilized to jailbreak many other unseen prompts $B_{test}$. Note that $B_{train} \cup B_{test} =B$ and $B_{train} \cap B_{test} =\emptyset$. 
Empirical studies illustrate that our approach possesses a strong prompt-universal property, as training imgJP over $M=25$ prompts is sufficient for generalization to other $300$ unseen prompts. 

\subsection{deltaJP-based Jailbreak}
The second scenario involves a provided input image $x_{in}$, and we are constrained to finding an image perturbation deltaJP $\delta$ such that the perturbed image $x_{in}+\delta$ allows the generation of objectionable content. It is worth noting that the $\delta$ is constrained by an attack budget $\epsilon$ to ensure that $x_{in}+\delta$ looks similar to the original input image $x_{in}$, as follows,
\begin{align}
    &\mathop{\max}_{\delta} \sum_{i=0}^{M} log(p(a_i| q_i, \widetilde{x})) \label{eq:deltajp0} \\
    &\text{s.t. } \widetilde{\bm{x}} \in [0,255]^d, \widetilde{\bm{x}}=\bm{x_{in}+ \delta}  \notag \\
    &\qquad ||\delta||_p < \epsilon \notag
\end{align}
where $\epsilon$ is the attack budget, and $\widetilde{\bm{x}}$ is the perturbed image.

Similar to the previous imgJP-based attack (Eq.(\ref{eq:imgjp})), the deltaJP-based attack (Eq.(\ref{eq:deltajp0})) is optimized over $M$ query-answer pairs $B_{train}$. 

In addition to the prompt-universal property, another universal property, \emph{i.e.,} the image-universal property, is desired in this deltaJP-based attack. Since users could provide any image as an input, a practical attack should succeed regardless of the input image. To achieve this, we integrate the universal adversarial attack strategy into our deltaJP-based attack. 

Specifically, we assume that the input images follow a specific distribution $\mathcal{D}$, such as belonging to a particular image category like ``images of bomb". Thus, given an image set $x_{j}\in D$ sampled from the specific distribution $\mathcal{D}$, we extend Eq.(\ref{eq:deltajp0}) as follows,
\vspace{-1.0em}
\begin{align}
    &\mathop{\max}_{\delta} \sum_{x_j\in D} \sum_{i=0}^{M} log(p(a_i| q_i, \widetilde{x}_j)) \label{eq:deltajp} \\
    &\text{s.t. } \widetilde{\bm{x}_j} \in [0,255]^d, \widetilde{\bm{x}_j}=\bm{x_j+ \delta}  \notag \\
    &\qquad ||\delta||_p < \epsilon \notag
\end{align}
where all images $x_{j}\in D$ share a universal perturbation $\delta$.

To address this problem, we employ the universal adversarial attack strategy. At each iteration, we compute the the minimal perturbation $\delta_j^t$
that directs the current perturbed point towards jailbreaking and aggregates it to the current instance of the universal perturbation $\delta^t$. 

\subsection{Ensemble Learning for Model-transferability}
Both imgJP-based and deltaJP-based attacks are designed for white-box attacks, assuming knowledge of the architecture and parameters of the target MLLM model. However, in real-world applications, this prior knowledge may be unavailable. Therefore, model-transferability becomes a crucial feature for black-box attack scenarios.

Specifically, we use a model as the surrogate model and conduct white-box attacks on it. Subsequently, the attack samples are transferred to attack the real target model. In this paper, we propose to ensemble multiple MLLMs as the surrogate model, which enhances the transferability of our attack. In general, the more models are ensembled for training, the higher transferability we achieve.

Specifically, we treat the MiniGPT-4(vicuna7B), MiniGPT-4(vicuna13B) and MiniGPT-4(LLaMA2) as three surrogate models. The imgJP jailbreak is extended as follows,
\begin{align}
    &\mathop{\max}_{x_{jp}} \sum_{k=1}^{3} \sum_{i=0}^{M} log(p_k(a_i| q_i, x_{jp})) \label{eq:em} \\
    &\text{s.t. }  x_{jp} \in [0,255]^d    \notag
\end{align}
where $p_1(a_i| q_i, x_{jp})$, $p_2(a_i| q_i, x_{jp})$, and $p_3(a_i| q_i, x_{jp})$ indicate the three surrogate models respectively. 

The solution to this optimization problem aims to find the optimal $x_{jp}$ across all three surrogate models. The empirical study demonstrates that such an ensemble scheme enables our approach to successfully transfer attack MiniGPT-v2, LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2. 

\subsection{Construction-base Method for LLM-jailbreaks}

A Multimodal LLM inherently contains a LLM within it. Thus, there is a close connection between MLLM- and LLM-jailbreaks, allowing us to leverage our MLLM-jailbreaking approach to conduct LLM-jailbreaking attacks efficiently.

Specifically, to jailbreak a target LLM, we first construct a MLLM that encapsulates it. This involves integrating a visual component into the LLM, where the visual output combines with users' text queries and is input to the target LLM. The placement of the image embedding can be either before or after the text embedding. Following the GCG \cite{zou2023universal} approach, we append the image embedding to the text embedding, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig3}.

Secondly, we perform our MLLM-jailbreak to acquire imgJP, while concurrently recording the embedding embJP. 

Thirdly, the embJP is reversed into text space through De-embedding and De-tokenizer operations. In LLMs, the embedding operation converts each discrete token $t$ to its embedding vector $e$, by looking up a token-embedding $(t, e)$ dictionary. Therefore, our De-embedding operation is designed to reverse this process—convert a continuous embedding vector back into a specific token. This involves a nearest neighbor search across the dictionary. For each embedding vector $e_l$ in embJP $(e_0, e_1, ..., e_{L-1})$, we identify the top-K similar embeddings $\hat{e}^k_l, k=0,...,K-1$ in the dictionary. Repeating this process for all $e_l, l=0,...,L-1$, yields a $K\times L$ embedding pool $\{\hat{e}_l^k\}_{k=0,l=0}^{K, L}$ and a corresponding $K\times L$ token pool $\{\hat{t}_l^k\}_{k=0,l=0}^{K,L}$. 

Consequently, De-tokenizer operation is designed to further convert those tokens back into words, yielding a $K\times L$ word pool $\{\hat{w}_l^k\}_{k=0,l=0}^{K,L}$. Finally, we can randomly sample some sequences of words from the word pool as the txtJP. The sampled txtJP can be utilized to jailbreak the target-LLM. 

Previous LLM-jailbreak methods, like GCG, typically directly sample sequences from a large $Z\times L$ word pool, where $Z>>K$ is the size of the word dictionary. In contrast, we first identify a successful embJP and utilize it to reduce the sampling space significantly. This approach results in a remarkable improvement in sampling efficiency.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:Implementation}
\noindent\textbf{Data sets. }
Until now, there is no existing multimodal dataset available for evaluating MLLM-jailbreaks. However, there are some pure text datasets for LLM-jailbreaking evaluation, such as \emph{AdvBench} \cite{zou2023universal}. Therefore, we construct a multimodal dataset, namely \emph{AdvBench-M}, based on AdvBench in this paper. 

In \emph{AdvBench}, a collection of $500$ harmful behaviors is gathered, where each item consists of a pair of \emph{instruction} sentence and a corresponding \emph{goal} sentence. The adversary’s goal of LLM-jailbreaks is to find a string txtJP that will cause the model to generate any response that complies with the \emph{instruction} and to do so over as many harmful behaviors as possible. The \emph{goal} sentence is a desired positive affirmation intended to be present at the beginning of the answer.

To construct our multimodal dataset \emph{AdvBench-M}, we need to collect images related to the provided instructions. 
Thus, We group all the harmful behaviors within AdvBench into $8$ distinct semantic categories, specifically, ``Bombs or Explosives", ``Drugs", ``Self-harm and Suicide", ``Cybersecurity and Privacy Issues", ``Physical Assault", ``Terrorism and Societal Tensions", ``Stock Market and Economy", and ``Firearms and Ammunition". For each category, $30$ semantic-relevant images were retrieved from the Internet using the Google search engine, coupled with %$30$ 
the corresponding harmful behaviors. \cref{tab_data} shows some examples in our \emph{AdvBench-M} dataset.

Our AdvBench-M is suitable for a detailed evaluation of jailbreaking due to the categorization of diverse harmful behaviors.

Note that AdvBench-M is particularly useful for evaluating the image-universal property in deltaJP-based jailbreaking, \emph{i.e.}, an adversary must find a deltaJP that, when added to any provided image within the same category, enables the model to generate responses to the instruction.

\noindent\textbf{Metrics. }
We use the Attack Success Rate (ASR) as the primary metric. Given a harmful prompt, if the model refuses to respond (\emph{e.g.,} responding with ``sorry, I cannot ...") or  generates some content irrelevant to the instruction, it is considered a failed jailbreak. If the model generates a relevant answer, it is considered a successful jailbreak. 

Due to the diverse responses from different MLLM models, we categorize a successful attack into three types based on the model’s response:  1) Type-I: generating harmful content in direct response to the instruction; 2) Type-II: generating responses that are partly related to the instruction and partly describing the harmful image content; 3) Type-III: repetition or rephrasing of harmful instruction, with less informative content. The examples for the three types of responses are shown in appendix.

\noindent\textbf{Test models. }
We examine several popular Multimodal LLMs, including MiniGPT-4 \cite{zhu2023minigpt}, MiniGPT-v2 \cite{chen2023minigpt}, LLaVA \cite{liu2023visual}, InstructBLIP \cite{instructblip}, mPLUG-Owl2 \cite{ye2023mplug}.%, ChatGPT-4V \cite{gpt4v}. 

MiniGPT-4 has three variants corresponding to three distinct LLM inside, \emph{i.e.,} Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B and LLaMA2, while MiniGPT-v2 just employs LLaMA2 as its LLM. 

For white-box jailbreaks, we evaluate our approach on MiniGPT-4 and MiniGPT-v2 separately. 
For evaluating model-transferaibility, we generate the imgJP on MiniGPT-4 and subsequently employ it for black-box attacks on MiniGPT-v2, LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2.% and ChatGPT-4V.

\subsection{White-box Jailbreaks}
We evaluate two white-box jailbreaking scenarios individually: one based on imgJP and the other based on deltaJP.

\noindent\textbf{imgJP-based Jailbreak. } In this scenario, we have the freedom to generate imgJP according to Eq.(\ref{eq:imgjp}). In practice, we can initialize $x_{jp}$ with the R, G, B values set to $128$. Since the images in AdvBench-M are not used, we mix the $8$ categories of behaviors in this experiment. 

Following the \cite{zou2023universal}, we evaluate our approach under two situations. The first is the \emph{Individual} situation, where we focus on a single prompt and attempt to find an imgJP to jailbreak it alone. This simply sets $M=1$ in Eq.(\ref{eq:imgjp}). From ~\cref{tab1}, we observe that we can successfully jailbreak all three MLLMs with an ASR of $77\%$. 

The second situation is the \emph{Multiple} situation, where we focus on evaluating the prompt-universal property. Specifically, we randomly select $M=25$ samples from AdvBench-M to learn the optimal imgJP and calculate the train ASR. Subsequently, we randomly select $100$ samples from the remaining data to calculate the test ASR, \emph{i.e.,} the prompt-universal performance.

From \cref{tab1}, we observe that the train ASR is about $88\%$ or $92\%$, much better than the individual situation. This is similar to the results of the LLM-jailbreaking in~\cite{zou2023universal}. It illustrates that the jailbreaking performance is inferior when focusing on a single harmful instruction, compared to jointly considering multiple harmful instructions. It implies that different harmful instructions are closely related to each other, thus jointly jailbreaking them could is superior to individual jailbreaks. Moreover, the test ASR is even higher than the train ASR, indicating that our approach possesses a strong prompt-universal property. 

\noindent\textbf{deltaJP-based Jailbreak. } In this scenario, we aim to find a deltaJP according to Eq.(\ref{eq:deltajp}). Both prompt-universal and image-universal properties should be considered. To this end, the evaluation is conducted individually for each category of AdvBench-M. Specifically, for each category, we randomly select $25$ instructions and $10$ images for training. After obtaining the optimal deltaJP on the training set, we randomly select $5$ instructions and $10$ images for testing. 

From \cref{tab2}, we observe that our approach exhibits a certain image-universal property. The ASR shows an imbalance among different classes, with the ``suicide" class being the most challenging case. Overall, this scenario presents a greater challenge compared to the imgJP-based jailbreak. 

\subsection{Model-transferability}
\label{sec:transfer_attack}
In real-world applications, the architecture and parameters of MLLMs are often unknown; thus, black-box jailbreaks are preferred in practice. The commonly used strategy is to leverage model-transferability. Specifically, we generate the imgJP on a surrogate model, the architecture and parameters of which are known. If our approach exhibits model-transferability, the generated imgJP is expected to be effective on the target model. 

In this experiment, we adopt an ensemble learning strategy to build a more generalized surrogate model as described in Eq.(\ref{eq:em}). Similar to the experimental setting of imgJP-based jailbreak, we randomly select $25$ harmful behaviors for training and $100$ held-out harmful behaviors for testing. We find the imgJP by solving Eq.(\ref{eq:em}) on the training data. After that, we evaluate the generated imgJP on four target MLLM models, which include mPLUG-Owl2, LLaVA, MiniGPT-v2, and InstructBLIP. 

The model-transferability can be measured with the test ASR. For a fine-grained evaluation, we use the three-type ASR as the metric, corresponding to three different kinds of jailbreaking behaviors. 

In particular, we adopt two surrogate models. The first surrogate model ensembles two MLLM models: MiniGPT-4(Vicuna7B) and MiniGPT-4(Vicuna13B), which is denoted as ``Vicuna" in \cref{tab3}. The second surrogate model ensembles three MLLM models: MiniGPT-4(Vicuna7B), MiniGPT-4(Vicuna7B), and MiniGPT-4(LLaMA2), which is denoted as ``Vicuna \& LLaMA2". Following \cite{zou2023universal}, we run these experiments twice with different random seeds to obtain two imgJP. We report the results for both averaging and ensembling the two imgJP.

From \cref{tab3}, we can successfully execute black-box attacks on all four models. It is evident that our approach exhibits strong transferability. Particularly, both mPLUG-Owl2 and MiniGPT-v2 are vulnerable to jailbreaking, with a total ASR of $59.0\%$. LLaVA can be jailbroken more easily than InstructBLIP. %And Qwen-VL is the most robust one against our attack. 

Furthermore, the performance of the second surrogate model surpasses that of the first surrogate model, indicating that ensembling more models leads to improved transferability.

Distinct MLLMs exhibit diverse behaviors when facing our attack. For instance, both mPLUG-Owl2 and LLaVA never output sentences belonging to Type-II and Type-III, thus we only provide $ASR_I$ for them. On the other hand, MiniGPT-v2 tends to generate Type-I output, while InstructBLIP tends to generate Type-II output. 

\subsection{Construction-base LLM-jailbreaks}
Our approach can jailbreak not only MLLM models but also LLM models. In this experiment, we compare our approach to some state-of-the-art LLM-jailbreaking methods, including GBDA \cite{guo2021gradient}, PEZ \cite{wen2023hard}, AutoPrompt \cite{shin2020autoprompt}, and GCG \cite{zou2023universal}. 

Regarding our construction-base method, after the De-embedding operation, we obtain a $K\times L$ embedding pool $\{\hat{e}_l^k\}_{k=0,l=0}^{K, L}$. To perform the final LLM-jailbreak, we will sample the sentence txtJP from the pool. There are several schemes to obtain txtJP. Specifically, for each embedding $e_l$, we find the top-K similar embeddings $\hat{e}^k_l, k=0,...,K-1$ in the dictionary, where they are sorted in descending order. The first scheme is to output the Top-1 similar embedding $\hat{e}^0_l$. The second is to randomly sample one $\hat{e}^k_l$ $(0\le k \le K-1)$. Both of them just output one txtJP. The third scheme is to repeat the random sampling $N$ times, producing $N$ candidate txtJPs, and try those txtJPs one by one. The third scheme is referred to as the ``RandSet'' in \cref{tab4}.

From \cref{tab4}, we observe that our ensemble scheme outperforms GCG on test ASR just with $N=5$. If we increase $N$ to 20, we achieve the train ASR of $92\%$ and the test ASR of $93\%$. It is worth noting that our ensemble scheme is much more efficient than GCG, since our approach is almost zero-cost (just performing inference 20 times), while GCG requires a time-consuming sampling procedure. 

\section{Conclusion}
This paper delves into jailbreaking attacks against multimodal large language models. 
We propose a maximum likelihood-based jailbreaking approach, which possesses a strong data-universal property, enabling jailbreaks across multiple unseen prompts and images. Moreover, it exhibits notable model-transferability, 
enabling black-box jailbreaking of various models such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2. More importantly, we reveal a connection between MLLM- and LLM-jailbreaks. We introduce a construction-based method to harness our approach for LLM-jailbreaks, demonstrating superior efficiency over state-of-the-art methods. 
In general, we conclude that jailbreaking MLLMs is easier than jailbreaking LLMs. Therefore, we strongly emphasize the serious concerns about MLLMs alignment.

\section{Ethics and Broader Impact}
This research contains material that could allow people to jailbreak some public MLLMs. Despite the associated risks, we believe it is important to fully disclose this research. 

As demonstrated in this paper, due to containing vulnerable visual modules, MLLMs are more susceptible to jailbreaking compared to pure LLMs. On the flip side, aligning a MLLM is much more challenging than aligning a LLM. Considering the widespread adoption of MLLMs, we anticipate the potential risks to grow. Our intention with this research is to shed light on the dangers posed by jailbreaking MLLMs and emphasize the critical concerns regarding the alignment of MLLMs.
