Your core task is to evaluate the checklists based on the user's instruction and LLM's response. You need to judge the checklist item based on the instruction and response. Please provide a comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, avoiding any potential bias and ensuring that the order in which the responses were presented does not affect your judgment. You should evaluate and compare the overall quality of the two following output candidates for the given input. And finally choose A or B or E (means almost the same).

Here is the rules of survey generated:

```rules
Your summary should follow these steps:
- Title: Clearly state the main subject or topic of the summary.
- Introduction: Describe the field and briefly introduce its history. Then introduce current progress and challenges.
- Introduce the main content of each paper separately. Then summarize their commonalities and innovations.
- Compare the results of the papers and discuss difference of the results.
- Conclusion: Summarize the main findings and suggest future research directions.

The following are the key points to note:
- If there are important data or mian equation in the given papers, remember to mention them in your summary using Markdown.
- Use of tables to clearly compare different approaches is encouraged.
- The first appearance of a professional term must be marked with the full English name and abbreviation.
- Don't directly copy the papers, write the summary in your own words.
- Do not include the titles of reference papers directly in your paper.
- Do not use citation command (like '\cite{xxx}')
```

Here is the survey given by A:
{{ response_A }}

Here is the survey given by B:
{{ response_B }}

Since the responses may be rather long, I am specifically reminding you here that the response has ended.

Here are checklists of this instruction:
"checklists": {{ checklists }}

To further remind you, I will repeat my requirements:

Your core task is to evaluate the checklists based on the user's instruction and LLM's response. You need to judge the checklist item based on the instruction and response. You should evaluate and compare the overall quality of the two following output candidates for the given input. Please provide a comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, avoiding any potential bias and ensuring that the order in which the responses were presented does not affect your judgment.

Always provide the reason for your evaluation results. You should be strict but fair in your evaluation. "A" means that the first response ( A's response ) perfectly better than the second response ( B's response ). "B" means that the second response ( B's response ) perfectly better than the first response ( A's response ). "E" means that two responses perform almost the same.

Evaluate all the checklists and return the evaluation results of the checklists. Output a Python List consisting of the Python Dictionary formatted as follows:
[{"checklist_id": "the id of the checklist", "reason": "The reason for your evaluation results", "winner": "Your choice of A or B or E"}, {"checklist_id": "the id of the checklist", "reason": "The reason for your evaluation results", "winner": "Your choice of A or B or E"}]

There are total {{ num_checklist }} checklists that you need to evaluate. The length of the output list is equal to the number of checklists. You should give a choice for each checklist. You should be strict to the evaluation to further compare the responses from different models. Your response must be a valid Python List and should contain nothing else, as it will be directly executed in Python.
