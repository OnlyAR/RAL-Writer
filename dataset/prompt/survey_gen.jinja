You are an experienced researcher, I will give you some scientific research papers in the same field. Please read them carefully and write a summary about them.

Here are the papers:
{% for paper in papers %}
<paper {{ loop.index }}>
{{ paper }}
</paper {{ loop.index }}>
{% endfor %}
Your summary should follow these steps:
- Title: Clearly state the main subject or topic of the summary.
- Introduction: Describe the field and briefly introduce its history. Then introduce current progress and challenges.
- Introduce the main content of each paper separately. Then summarize their commonalities and innovations.
- Compare the results of the papers and discuss difference of the results.
- Conclusion: Summarize the main findings and suggest future research directions.

The following are the key points to note:
- If there are important data or mian equation in the given papers, remember to mention them in your summary using Markdown.
- Use of tables to clearly compare different approaches is encouraged.
- The first appearance of a professional term must be marked with the full English name and abbreviation.
