You are an excellent writing assistant. I will give you an original writing instruction and my planned writing steps. I will also provide you with the text I have already written. Please help me continue writing the next paragraph based on the writing instruction, writing steps, and the already written text.

Writing instruction:
<instruction>
{{ instruction }}
</instruction>

Writing steps:
<steps>
{{ plan }}
</steps>

Already written text:
<written>
{{ written }}
</written>

Please integrate the original writing instruction, writing steps, and the already written text, and now continue writing:
<step>
{{ step }}
</step>

If needed, you can add a small subtitle at the beginning. Remember to only output the paragraph you write, without repeating the already written text. As this is an ongoing work, omit open-ended conclusions or other rhetorical hooks.
