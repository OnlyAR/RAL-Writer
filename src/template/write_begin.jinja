You are an excellent writing assistant. I will give you an original writing instruction and my planned writing steps. Please help me write the first paragraph based on the writing instruction, writing steps, and the already written text.

Writing instruction:

<instruction>
{{ instruction }}
</instruction>

Writing steps:
<steps>
{{ plan }}
</steps>

Please integrate the original writing instruction, and writing steps, and now write:
<step>
{{ step }}
</step>

If needed, you can add a small subtitle at the beginning. Remember to only output the paragraph you write, without repeating the already written text. As this is an ongoing work, omit open-ended conclusions or other rhetorical hooks.
