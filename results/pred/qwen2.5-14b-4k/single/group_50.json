However, in tasks involving video instruction-following, providing informative feedback, especially for detecting hallucinations in generated responses, remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have explored using large large multimodal models (LMMs) as reward models to guide preference modeling, but their ability to accurately assess the factuality of generated responses compared to corresponding videos has not been conclusively established. This paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes detailed video captions as a proxy of video content, enabling language models to incorporate this information as supporting evidence for scoring video Question Answering (QA) predictions. Our approach demonstrates robust alignment with OpenAI \\gptv model's reward mechanism, which directly takes video frames as input. Furthermore, we show that applying this tailored reward through DPO significantly improves the performance of video LMMs on video QA tasks.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\nThis paper addresses the challenge of aligning LMMs, particularly in tasks that involve video instruction following. Despite recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL)~\\citep{ouyang2022training, bai2022constitutional, lee2023rlaif, sun2023salmon} and DPO~\\citep{rafailov2024direct, chen2024self, hosseini2024v}, which have been effective in guiding LLMs towards generating more honest, helpful, and harmless content, their effectiveness in multimodal contexts remains limited. The critical obstacle lies in developing a robust reward system capable of distinguishing preferred responses from less preferred ones, especially when such responses are generated based on video inputs. The challenge is further complicated by the presence of hallucinations in generated content, stemming from the scarcity of alignment data across different modalities~\\citep{liu2023visual, sun2023aligning}.\n\nWhile human preference data is valuable, it is challenging to scale due to its cost and labor-intensive nature, as highlighted by the LLaVA-RLHF~\\citep{sun2023aligning} paper, which collected 10k human-evaluated instances at a considerable cost of \\$3000. Existing approaches for distlling preferences, such as those for image data using \\gptv~\\citep{li2023silkie}, encounter scalability issues, especially for video inputs that require analyzing multiple frames. While \\cite{ahn2024tuning} leverage a supervised finetuning (SFT) model for self-evaluation, the efficacy of the SFT model remains uncertain, particularly in accurately assessing the factuality of responses in relation to their corresponding videos.\n\nTo tackle the aforementioned challenges, we introduce a cost-effective reward mechanism aimed at reliably evaluating the quality of responses generated by video (LLMs), serving as a basis for further preference optimization. \nWe propose the use of detailed video captions as a proxy for video content, enabling a language model analyze video content and assess the accuracy of an LMM's response to a related question and determine the presence of hallucinations. The language model provides natural language feedback as a chain-of-thought step, and generates a numerical score for reward, facilitating a cost-effective feedback system. \n\nHowever, high-quality video captions are essential for this process. To mitigate the shortage of high-quality video captions, we have developed a comprehensive video caption dataset, \\datasetname, using a novel prompting technique with the \\gptv model, comprising 900k captions that encompass a wide range of video content, including temporal dynamics, world knowledge, object attributes, and spatial relationships.\nWith this video caption dataset available, we verify that our reward mechanism, which utilizes video captions as a proxy, is well-aligned with evaluations derived from the more powerful, albeit costlier, \\gptv model-generated rewards. Employing this reward mechanism as the basis for DPO algorithm, we train \\modelname that achieves an 8.1\\% accuracy improvement over the SFT counterpart. This marks a significant advancement in video LMM alignment and represents the first successful application of a DPO method in this domain.\n\nOur contributions are outlined as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item We develop a large-scale, detailed video caption dataset, covering a wide array of content. This dataset serves as a foundational resource for LMM model training and research, facilitating advancements in video understanding tasks.\n    \\item We introduce a cost-effective method for evaluating video instruction-following tasks, serving as enhanced evaluation of model performance. \n    \\item We demonstrate the effective application of DPO to improve model performance by leveraging the language model feedback as reward, which substantially improves the alignment of video LMM, establishing a new benchmark for SOTA performance in video QA tasks.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection{Large Multi-Modal Models}\nLMMs ~\\citep{liu2023visual, liu2023improved, bai2023qwen, chen2023shikra, li2023blip} have enabled instruction following across modalities by utilizing LLM as backbones. In the context of video understanding, LLMs have been adapted to process video content~\\citep{lin2023videollava, zhang2023video, maaz2023video, li2023videochat, luo2023valley, liu2023one, jin2024video, ahn2024tuning}. Our work adots \\videollava backbone, focusing on model enhancement through preference modeling with the DPO technique.\n\n\\subsection{Video-text Datasets}\nExisting video-text datasets typically provide brief sentences or mere keywords as captions, as indicated by \\cite{bain2021frozen, wang2023internvid, yu2019activitynet, jang2017tgif, xu2016msr}. \\cite{shvetsova2023howtocaption} uses automatic speech recognition to extract textual content from videos, but it encounters alignment issues when the audio does not match or is absent from the visual content. Video-ChatGPT \\citep{li2023videochat} employs human effort to create high-quality video instructions, albeit limited to the ActivityNet domain with only 100k instruction pairs. Our work leverages the \\gptv model with specifically crafted prompts to produce detailed video captions as community resource for LMM training.\n\n\\subsection{Preference Modeling for LMMs}\nPreference modeling techniques are employed to enhance the utility of LMMs while mitigating the issue of hallucination. \\cite{sun2023aligning}  leveraged Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and incorporated caption information into the reward model to improve the assessment of factuality. More recently, \\cite{ahn2024tuning} used RL on AI feedback to improve video LMM performance. For the image understanding, \\cite{li2023silkie, gunjal2023detecting} introduced the application of DPO on the distilled rewards from \\gptv on a group of model outputs, while \\cite{zhao2023beyond} created preference data using \\chatgpt to generate positive and negative pairs informed by detailed image descriptions. Our contribution extends DPO to the video LMM alignment, with the use of detailed captions as factual evidence for reward modeling.\n\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{fig/illustration.pdf}\n    \\caption{Workflow diagram showing: a) the use of \\gptv for creating a detailed caption dataset for videos; b) generating video instruction data for SFT; c) integrating captions into a feedback loop for factually-enhanced DPO, improving the model's performance on video instruction-following tasks.}\n    \\label{fig:illustration}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Method}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\nAs shown in \\cref{fig:illustration}, our methodology enhances video LMM alignment through DPO method using rewards from a language model. We elaborate on constructing a video caption dataset in \\cref{subsec:caption_distillation}. Subsequently, in \\cref{subsec:sft}, we discuss the generation of video instruction data and the fine-tuning process of our model. Lastly, \\cref{subsec:dpo} details the incorporation of generated captions as a feedback mechanism for DPO method to refine our model's factual alignment in video instruction-following tasks.\n\n\\subsection{Prompting \\gptv Model for Detailed Video Caption Distillation}\n\\label{subsec:caption_distillation}\nThe selection of dataset includes videos from three sources: the \\webvid and \\vidal datasets, which are general domain videos sourced from YouTube with 400k and 450k sampled videos respectively, and the \\actnet dataset, which adds 50k videos focusing on human activities. The three datasets together result in a comprehensive collection of \\pnum videos. To accommodate the requirement that \\gptv only takes images as input, we preprocess videos by uniformly extracting ten frames per video content. These frames are then concatenated into a sequence to serve as a proxy for the video. This sequence is the input into \\gptv to generate a coherent caption for the represented video based on the frame sequence. The prompt adheres to guidelines covering temporal dynamics, world knowledge, object attributes, spatial relationships, aesthetic assessments, etc., with the goal of comprehensively understanding the video contents.\n\n\\subsection{SFT with Generated Video Instruction Data from Detailed Caption}\n\\label{subsec:sft}\nTo generate video instruction-following data for SFT, we adopt a similar methodology outlined in Video-ChatGPT~\\citep{li2023videochat}. Specifically, we first randomly sample 20k, 30k, 30k captions in our dataset from \\actnet, \\webvid and \\vidal respective and then employ \\chatgpt to generate three question-answer pairs given each detailed video caption, resulting in a total of 240k instruction data for finetuning. This approach ensures that the instructional data remains factually consistent with the content of the detailed captions. The specific prompting strategy used for this instruction generation process is detailed in \\cref{fig:chatgpt_instruction_generation}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{fig/dpo_figure.pdf}\n    \\caption{Detailed illustration of the proposed factually-enhanced DPO method.}\n    \\label{fig:dpo_illustration}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{DPO with Feedback from Language Model as Reward}\n\\label{subsec:dpo}\nAcquiring high-quality preference data is both costly and labor-intensive. Although \\gptv is an effective model for reward distillation, its high cost, slow performance, and limited accessibility hinder scalability, especially for video inputs with multiple frames. We propose a cost-efficient method to generate reward data for DPO using detailed video captions as supporting evidence, as shown in \\cref{fig:dpo_illustration}.\n\nInitially, we randomly select a subset of 20k instruction pairs from the dataset described in \\cref{subsec:sft}. The SFT model uses these sampled questions and their corresponding videos to generate six responses per input pair at a temperature of $1.0$. This procedure results in 120k question-answer pairs, which will be evaluated. Subsequently, we employ \\chatgpt to process inputs including a question, the ground truth answer, the model's prediction, and a detailed description serving as supportive evidence, with the prompt in \\cref{fig:chatgpt_verifier}. This generates an output that includes a natural language explanation as chain-of-thought step, followed by a numerical reward score on a scale from $1$ to $5$, indicating the level of factual alignment and overall quality.\n\nFor each video and question pair, we randomly select an answer with a score $\\ge$ 3 as positive example, and an answer with a score below $3$ as negative. Cases where all responses are uniformly scored above or below $3$ are excluded from the dataset. After the selection process, approximately 17k training instances are compiled for DPO training. Formally, the dataset is denoted as $\\mathcal{D}_{DPO} = \\{ (\\mathcal{V}, x, y_w, y_l )\\}$, where $\\mathcal{V}$ is the video, $x$ is the question, $y_w$ and $y_l$ are the positive and negative responses. The DPO objective is defined as below:\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\resizebox{.95\\hsize}{!}{$\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{DPO}}\\left(\\pi_\\theta ; \\pi_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)=-\\mathbb{E}_{\\left(\\mathcal{V}, x, y_w, y_l\\right) \\sim \\mathcal{D}_{DPO}}\\left[\\log \\sigma\\left(\\beta \\log \\frac{\\pi_\\theta\\left(y_w \\mid x,\\mathcal{V} \\right)}{\\pi_{\\text {ref }}\\left(y_w \\mid x,\\mathcal{V}\\right)}-\\beta \\log \\frac{\\pi_\\theta\\left(y_l \\mid x,\\mathcal{V}\\right)}{\\pi_{\\text {ref }}\\left(y_l \\mid x,\\mathcal{V}\\right)}\\right)\\right]\\,,$}\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\pi_\\theta$ is the policy model to be optimized and $\\pi_{\\text {ref }}$ is the base reference model, both models are initialized with SFT weights. $\\sigmoid$ is the logistic function and $\\beta$ is set to $0.1$.\n\nOur approach to reward assignment leverages detailed captions as a proxy for video frames, offering both cost-effectiveness and efficiency. This method incurs costs of less than \\$20, under a pricing model of \\$1.5 per million tokens. In comparison, previous methods of preference data collection, such as in \\cite{sun2023aligning}, required an expenditure of \\$3,000 to gather 10k human preference data points. Additionally, the method proposed by \\cite{li2023silkie}, which employs \\gptv for reward data labeling, incurs a significantly higher cost—\\$30 per million tokens—and demonstrates considerably slower inference speeds.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\linewidth, valign=t]{fig/score_diff.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\linewidth, valign=t]{fig/agree_4v.pdf} \n\\caption{Assessing Evaluator Quality Using Captions in Place of Frames. The left figure shows the distribution of evaluation score differences between \\chatgpt (with caption as proxy) and \\gptv (directly on frames) evaluations. The right figure shows the rate of preference agreement between \\chatgpt and \\gptv as evaluators.}\n\n\\label{fig:evaluator_assessment}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Assessment of Evaluator with \\gptv Caption as Evidence}\n\\label{sec:evaluator_assessment}\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of our proposed reward assignment method, which utilizes detailed captions as a proxy of actual video frames, we conducted a comparative analysis with the \\gptv, used as a video QA evaluator. The latter reward system employs \\gptv evaluation directly taking in video frames, a question, and the model prediction as inputs, with detailed prompt in \\cref{fig:gptv_verifier}. Both reward systems follow the same set of guidelines for scoring reward. \n\nTo compare the two methods, we sample $200$ videos from each of the \\webvid, \\vidal, and \\actnet datasets, each associated with one question and two model predictions from our SFT model, with one preferred and one dispreferred by \\chatgpt. This results in $1,200$ examples, for which we used \\gptv (with the \"gpt-4-vision-preview\" version) version to assign scores. Filtering through the Azure API backend resulted in $196$, $151$, and $143$ videos from each dataset, respectively, having both answers evaluated. The average scores of all examples from \\chatgpt and \\gptv evaluations were $2.9$ and $3.5$ respectively, indicating a tendency of \\gptv to yield slightly positive evaluations. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of $0.47$ ($p<0.01$) suggests a moderate positive correlation. In \\cref{fig:evaluator_assessment} (left), the distribution of the difference between \\chatgpt and \\gptv scores reveals that majority ($>75\\%$) of \\chatgpt scores fall within one standard deviation ($\\sigma=1.31$) of \\gptv scores. Additionally, in \\cref{fig:evaluator_assessment} (right), the agreement on preference between \\chatgpt and \\gptv, excluding ties, exceeded $70\\%$. These findings cautiously support our benchmark's applicability in video QA evaluation. Further refinements for better alignment—such as incorporating Likert scales~\\cite{zhou2023sotopia} or \\gptf evaluation—are areas for future research.\n\\begin{table*}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\resizebox{1.0\\linewidth}{!}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{lccccccc}\n    \\toprule\n    & & \\multicolumn{6}{c}{\\bf Existing Video QA Benchmark from \\cite{maaz2023video}} \\\\\n    \\multirow{2}{*}{\\textbf{Methods}}\n    & \\multirow{2}{*}{\\textbf{LLM Size}}\n    & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{MSVD-QA}}\n    & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{MSRVTT-QA}}\n    & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{TGIF-QA}}  \\\\\n    \\cmidrule(lr){3-4}                  \n    \\cmidrule(lr){5-6}\n    \\cmidrule(lr){7-8}\n    &\n    & Acc. & Score \n    & Acc. & Score \n    & Acc. & Score \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    FrozenBiLM~\\citep{yang2022zero}$*$      \n            & 1B & 32.2 & - & 16.8  & - & 41.0 & - \\\\\n    VideoLLaMA~\\citep{zhang2023video}$*$\n            & 7B & 51.6 & 2.5 & 29.6 & 1.8 & - & - \\\\\n    LLaMA-Adapter~\\citep{zhang2023llama}$*$\n            & 7B & 54.9 & 3.1 & 43.8 & 2.7 & - & - \\\\\n    VideoChat~\\citep{li2023videochat}$*$\n            & 7B\n            & 56.3 & 2.8 & 45.0 & 2.5 & 34.4 & 2.3 \\\\\n    BT-Adapter~\\cite{liu2023one}$*$\n            & 7B & 67.5 & 3.7 & 57.0 & 3.2 & - & - \\\\\n    Video-ChatGPT~\\citep{maaz2023video}\n            & 7B & 68.6 & 3.8 & 58.9 & 3.4 & 47.8 & 3.2 \\\\\n    Chat-UniVi~\\citep{Chat-UniVi} & 7B & 70.0 & 3.8 & 53.1 & 3.1 & 46.1 & 3.1 \\\\\n    VideoChat2~\\cite{li2023mvbench}\n            & 7B & 70.0 & 3.9 & 54.1 & 3.3 & - & - \\\\\n    Video-LLaVA~\\cite{lin2023video}\n            & 7B & 71.8 & 3.9 & 59.0 & 3.4 & 48.4 & 3.2 \\\\\n    LLaMA-VID~\\citep{li2023llama}\n            & 7B & 72.6 & 3.9 & 58.7 & 3.4 & 49.2 & 3.3 \\\\\n    LLaMA-VID~\\cite{li2023llama}\n            & 13B & 74.3 & 4.0 & 59.8 & 3.4 & 50.8 & 3.3 \\\\\n    VLM-RLAIF~\\citep{ahn2024tuning}$*$ & 7B & 76.4 & 4.0 & 63.0 & 3.4 & - & - \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\modelsft  & 7B & 75.7 & 3.9 & 58.7 & 3.3 & 53.5 & 3.3 \\\\\n    \\modelname & 7B & \\textbf{80.7} & \\textbf{4.1} & \\textbf{70.2} & \\textbf{3.7} & \\textbf{61.4} & \\textbf{3.5} \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n}\n\\caption{\n\\textbf{Evaluation of Model Performance on Zero-Shot Video Question Answering Benchmarks Using gpt-3.5-turbo-0613.} Models denoted with $*$ have their results directly sourced from their original publications.

All other baseline models were reproduced by our team. \n}\n\\label{tab:official_eval}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\section{Experimental Results}\n\\subsection{Model Architecture, Image Data Mix-up and  Training Pipelines }\nWe adopt \\videollava ~\\citep{lin2023videollava} as the backbone of our video LMM, but our dataset and method can be applied to any other architectures as well. Specifically, \\videollava employs LanguageBind ~\\citep{zhu2023languagebind} encoder for image and video frame inputs, a MLP projector with 2 fully connected layers to map visual embeddings into text space, and Vicuna~\\cite{chiang2023vicuna} as large language model. During training, we first initialize the projection MLP layer with the \nsame \\videollava MLP weight. Then we follow the training stages below:\n\n\\noindent \\textbf{Caption Pre-training Stage (\\modelpt):}\nAt pretraining stage, we use captioning data including 650k image caption data from ALLaVA ~\\citep{chen2024allava} and our distilled 900k video caption. We freeze the LanguageBind visual encoder and fine-tune the MLP projector and LLM, with learning rate 2e-5 and batch size 128.\n\n\\noindent \\textbf{SFT Stage (\\modelsft):}\nWe use instructional data from both image and video domain to fine-tune the model for instruction-following ability. Our SFT model use\n 600k image instruction data from ALLaVA and our generated 240k video instruction data, with learning rate 5e-6 and batch size 128.\n\n\\noindent \\textbf{DPO training Stage (\\modelname):}\nWe use the 17k preference data introduced in \\cref{subsec:dpo} for DPO training. Following \\cite{ivison2023camels}, we train our policy model for $3$ epochs with learning rate 5e-7, and a batch size of 128, resulting in roughly 420 training steps. All the experiments are performed on 8 A100 gpus.\n\n\\subsection{Existing Benchmark Evaluation}\n\\paragraph{Dataset and Testing Environment}\nWe evaluate model performance on three benchmark datasets: \\msvd-QA~\\cite{chen2011collecting}, \\msrvtt-QA~\\cite{xu2016msr}, and TGIF-QA~\\cite{jang2017tgif}, using \\chatgpt with version gpt-3.5-turbo-0611 to assess model predictions. The evaluation prompts follow  \\cite{maaz2023video}. In our experiment, we found that different ChatGPT versions have high impact on absolute score of metric, but the overall ranking of models is relatively stable. We select gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 due to its closeness to the reported score in \\videollava paper. Further details on the selection rationale and evaluation pitfalls are discussed in Appendix~\\ref{apd:official_evaluation}.\n\n\\paragraph{Baseline Selection}\nOur selection criteria include video LMM models that have demonstrated SOTA performance, specifically including \\videollava, which is also our choice of architecture. We consider other contemporaneous SOTA models with similar reported performance levels to \\videollava, yet have not been directly compared in prior studies. A key consideration in our selection is the availability of models with accessible code and checkpoints, which is crucial for ensuring reproducibility of our findings. To this end, we replicate models including Video-ChatGPT~\\citep{maaz2023video}, LLaMA-VID~\\citep{li2023llama} (7B and 13B), Chat-UniVi~\\citep{Chat-UniVi}, and Video-LLaVA~\\cite{lin2023video}. We adopt the results from additional baselines including FrozenBiLM~\\citep{yang2022zero}, VideoChat~\\citep{li2023videochat} and VideoLLaMA~\\citep{zhang2023video}, sourced from their original publication. \n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\vspace{-1cm}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{fig/cases2.pdf}\n    \\caption{Examples from MSRVTT-QA and MSVD-QA showcase that our \\modelname generates better responses, and reveal key limitations of the existing benchmark evaluation.}\n    \\label{fig:error-analysis}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Results} In \\cref{tab:official_eval}, our analysis shows that within the SFT models, LLaMA-VID-7B and \\videollava exhibit comparable performance, with LLaMA-VID-13B performing the best. Our \\modelsft model achieves comparable performance to LLaMA-VID-13B. Incorporating preference modeling, \\modelname achieves an average accuracy of $70.75\\%$, surpassing \\modelsft, which has an average accuracy of $62.65\\%$, by $8.1\\%$. Furthermore, \\modelname, enhanced by DPO, exhibits superior accuracy compared to VLM-RLAIF's performance achieved through reinforcement learning.\n\n\\paragraph{Error Analysis} \\Cref{fig:error-analysis} illustrates two examples. In the left example, \\modelsft provides an accurate description of the video's first half but introduces a hallucination with the phrase ``I'm not scared of space,\" absent in the video content. \\modelname yields a more accurate inference. In the right example, both \\modelsft and \\videollava models produce incorrect inferences, whereas \\modelname successfully correctly identifies the subject in the video. More critically, these examples unveil two significant issues within the current benchmark: (1) the auto-generated questions from existing benchmark may be grammatically incorrect or even nonsensical, and (2) the answers are limited to a \\textit{single} word, which is insufficient for evaluating LMMs with long-form text generation. Such constraints in the ground truth answers hinder the evaluation of crucial aspects like helpfulness and hallucination detection.\n\n\\subsection{Proposed Benchmark Evaluation with \\gptv Caption as Supporting Evidence}\nAs a solution to the above limitations in existing benchmark evaluation, we propose a new set of test questions for same videos in the benchmark datasets with generated QA from detailed captions, illustrated in \\cref{apd:video_qa}. Applying the our reward system in \\cref{sec:evaluator_assessment}, we report the score from \\chatgpt, and a score value $\\ge 3$ will be considered correct for accuracy calculation. This new long-form QA evaluation potentially support diverse aspects in responses including relevance, accuracy, clarity and completeness in prompt \\ref{fig:gptv_verifier}.\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\resizebox{1.0\\linewidth}{!}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{clcccccc}\n    \\toprule\n    & & \\multicolumn{6}{c}{\\bf Proposed Video QA Benchmark (In-domain)} \\\\\n    \\multirow{2}{*}{\\textbf{No.}} & \\multirow{2}{*}{\\textbf{Methods}}\n    & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{\\actnet-QA}}\n    & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{\\vidal-QA}}\n    & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{\\webvid-QA}}  \\\\  \n    \\cmidrule(lr){3-4}                  \n    \\cmidrule(lr){5-6}\n    \\cmidrule(lr){7-8}\n    & & Acc. & Score \n    & Acc. & Score \n    & Acc. & Score \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\text{[1]} & Video-ChatGPT~\\citep{maaz2023video} &  34.17 & 2.19 & 29.35 & 2.10 & 38.88 & 2.27 \\\\\n    \\text{[2]} & LLaMA-VID-7B~\\citep{li2023llama}  & 36.54 & 2.27 & 30.58 & 2.15 & 36.99 & 2.24 \\\\\n    \\text{[3]} & LLaMA-VID-13B~\\citep{li2023llama}  & 37.33 & 2.29 & 32.50 & 2.18 & 39.73 & 2.30 \\\\\n    \\text{[4]} & Chat-UniVi~\\citep{Chat-UniVi}  & 39.35 & 2.32 & 31.40 & 2.16 & 40.05 & 2.31 \\\\\n    \\text{[5]} & Video-LLaVA~\\cite{lin2023video} & 41.35 & 2.38 & 34.30 & 2.24 & 42.47 & 2.39 \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\text{[6]} & \\modelsft & 66.62 & 3.05 & 60.50 & 2.88 & 71.07 & 3.17 \\\\\n    \\text{[7]} & \\modelname & \\bf 76.62 & \\bf 3.18 & \\bf 70.06 & \\bf 3.04 & \\bf 79.82 & \\bf 3.29  \\\\\n    \\hline \\hline\n    \\text{[8]} & \\modelpt + Image Inst. & 69.31 & 3.09 & 60.57 & 2.85 & 68.03 & 3.02 \\\\\n    \\text{[9]} & \\modelpt + VChat & 67.34 & 3.02 & 62.33 & 2.89 & 68.98 & 3.00  \\\\\n    \\text{[10]} & \\modelname + training MLP & 71.89 & 3.10 & 65.57 & 2.95 & 75.37 & 3.21 \\\\\n    \\text{[11]} & \\modelsft + Self-play & 64.11 & 2.85 & 56.28 & 2.68 & 67.89 &2.95 \\\\ \n    \\text{[12]} & \\modelname w/ lr3e-7 & 71.13 & 3.08 & 64.90 & 2.92 & 73.25 & 3.17\\\\ \n    \\bottomrule\n    \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n}\n\\caption{\nOur proposed video QA benchmark evaluation on in-domain dataset using gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, with detailed captions as supporting evidence.\n}\n\\label{tab:indomain_eval}\n\\end{table*}\n\n    \n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{lcccccccc}\n    \\toprule\n    & \\multicolumn{8}{c}{\\bf Proposed Video QA Benchmark (Out-of-domain)} \\\\\n    \\multirow{2}{*}{\\textbf{Methods}}\n    & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{\\msvd-QA}}\n    & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{\\msrvtt-QA}}\n    & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{\\tgif-QA}}  \n    & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{\\ssvt-QA}} \\\\  \n    \\cmidrule(lr){2-3}                  \n    \\cmidrule(lr){4-5}\n    \\cmidrule(lr){6-7}\n    \\cmidrule(lr){8-9}\n    & Acc. & Score \n    & Acc. & Score \n    & Acc. & Score \n    & Acc. & Score \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    Video-ChatGPT~\\citep{maaz2023video} &  34.06 & 2.20 & 25.65 & 1.98 & 31.35 & 2.09 & 19.36 & 1.75 \\\\\n    LLaMA-VID-7B~\\citep{li2023llama}  & 34.14 & 2.21 & 25.02 & 1.99 & 27.18 & 2.00 & 22.16 & 1.84 \\\\\n    LLaMA-VID-13B~\\citep{li2023llama} & 35.81 & 2.25 & 26.34 & 2.02 & 27.58 & 2.01 & 21.98 & 1.83 \\\\\n    Chat-UniVi~\\citep{Chat-UniVi} & 35.61 & 2.23 & 25.89 & 2.01 & 33.23 & 2.13 & 20.59 & 1.79 \\\\\n    Video-LLaVA~\\cite{lin2023video} & 39.46 & 2.37 & 30.78 & 2.15 & 32.95 & 2.18 & 24.31 & 1.90 \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\modelsft & 66.99 & 3.09 & 57.82 & 2.85 & 66.13 & 3.07 & 35.07 & 2.23 \\\\\n    \\modelname & \\bf 73.64 & \\bf 3.12& \\bf68.29 & \\bf 2.98 & \\bf 74.00 & \\bf 3.12 & \\bf 48.89 & \\bf 2.53  \\\\\n    \\hline \\hline\n    \\modelpt + Image Inst. & 65.19 & 2.96 & 48.66 & 2.52 & 53.83 & 2.62 & 29.60 & 2.04 \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n}\n\\caption{\nOur proposed video QA benchmark evaluation on out-of-domain dataset using gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, with detailed captions as supporting evidence.\n}\n\\label{tab:outdomain_eval}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\Cref{tab:indomain_eval} and \\cref{tab:outdomain_eval} shows the in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation. We use \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0301\" for evaluation as it is the same version for constructing DPO dataset. \nThe model performance is more distinguishable from our evaluation with \\videollava performing the best among the other baseline models. %\\modelsft output performs the previous model by a large margin. \n\n\\textbf{Video LMM without Video Instruction:} [8] in \\cref{tab:indomain_eval} is baseline trained with only image instruction fine-tuned on \\modelpt, which achieves an average accuracy of $65.97\\%$, comparable to the \\modelsft model's $66.06\\%$ in in-domain QA scenarios. However, its performance significantly drops in out-of-domain QA contexts ($49.32\\%$ vs. $56.50\\%$), suggesting that Video QA training could potentially enhance generalization capabilities. \n\n\\textbf{Quality of Generated SFT:} [9] substitutes our generated video QA  with the Video-ChatGPT dataset for \\videollava fine-tuning. A comparison between the findings of [9] and [6] reveals a marginal performance disparity of $0.2\\%$ in average accuracy, indicating that the quality of our generated QA closely parallels that of the existing video QA datasets. Given the similar quality in SFT data, the large gain of [6] over [5] can be reasonably concluded from large-scale pre-training on video captions.\n\n\\textbf{Unfreeze MLP:} The comparison between [10] and [7] reveals a significant decrease in performance when the MLP is unfrozen during DPO training. Despite this drop, however, the performance remains superior to that of the SFT baseline.\n\n\\textbf{Smaller Learning Rate:} The comparison between [12] and [7] reveals that using a smaller learning rate of 3e-7 (vs. 5e-7) results in a decreasing of model performance. This highlights the future improvements by finding better hyperparameters.\n\n\\textbf{Self-Play vs. DPO:} \\cite{chen2024self} introduced a self-play methodology for DPO training, which designates ground truth answers as preferred and model-generated responses as dispreferred. When comparing the results of [11] with those in [6], a notable decrease in accuracy by $3\\%$ from the SFT model is observed, suggesting that self-play may be less effective for video LMM alignment, and introducing reward model is helpful.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\vspace{-0.6cm}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth]{fig/outdomain_dpo.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth]{fig/outdomain_dpo_ranker.pdf} \n\\caption{The left figure shows the test set accuracy of the DPO model w.r.t the number of training epochs.

We observe a consistent enhancement in model performance among datasets during the initial 0 to 2 epochs, with peak performance materializing at around 2.5 epochs, which corresponds to 350 training steps.\n\n\\textbf{DPO as Ranker vs. Generator.}\nFollowing \\cite{hosseini2024v}, we compare the performance of employing the DPO model as a ranker for candidate answers produced by the SFT model, operating at a temperature setting of 1.0. As depicted on the right in \\cref{fig:dpo_ablation}, we illustrate the test accuracy progression through the selection of the best among $N$ candidates by the DPO ranker. Initial observations indicate that the SFT model, when set to a temperature of 1.0, demonstrates a reduced accuracy (43.3\\%) compared to that achieved through greedy decoding (57.8\\%). A steady enhancement in performance is noted as the number of candidates increases, plateauing at an accuracy of approximately 62\\% with 64 candidates. This performance, however, falls short when compared with the direct application of the DPO model for answer generation, which yields an accuracy of 68.29\\%. This difference suggests the stronger generalization of DPO model in answer generation, despite it is trained on a reward classification loss. The contradictory results to \\cite{hosseini2024v} may be due to the difference of tasks, i.e. Math vs. Video QA.\nRefer to \\cref{apd:dpo} for more results.\n\n\\subsection{Analysis on Video Captioning Ability from Pre-training}\n\\vspace{-0.4cm}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth]{fig/in-domain-gpt-4v-evaluation.pdf} & \n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth]{fig/out-of-domain-gpt-4v-evaluation.pdf} \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{The video caption ability w.r.t number of training data evaluated on both in-domain and out-of-domain test videos using \\gptv. %The comparison with GPT-4V and \\videollava shows that augmenting distilled data enhances model performance on both in-domain (left) and out-of-domain (right) data.\n}\n\\label{fig:overall_caption_trend}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn \\Cref{fig:overall_caption_trend}, we present the video captioning ability of models across various datasets, with a total of 900k distilled data instances. GPT-4V is employed for self-evaluation (\\cref{fig:gpt4v_evaluation}), serving as the upper-bound performance, while the \\videollava serves for comparative analysis, establishing a baseline. Notably, \\videollava is trained on 54k video QA data instances. However, our first checkpoint, utilizing only 10\\% of the data, is trained on 90k high-quality caption data instances, likely accounting for the observed performance disparity in the video captioning task. Our results demonstrate that incorporating more distilled data contributes to improved model performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Despite these improvements, a performance discrepancy with the GPT-4V model remains. Further, we evaluate the generalization potential in specific data subsets, as shown in \\cref{fig:indomain_caption_trend} in the Appendix. These subsets reveal varying degrees of generalization challenges for different types of dataset. For example, the \\webvid subset, which concentrates on relatively static scenes, necessitates less data for effective training compared to the \\vidal subset, which is marked by dynamic scene transitions and a diversity of video themes.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIn this study, we propose an cost-effective reward system that utilizes detailed captions as proxies for video content. Our findings demonstrate that the reward scores is well-aligned with the evaluation metrics of \\gptv, and the incorporation of this reward mechanism enhances DPO training, resulting in SOTA performance on video QA tasks.\n\n\\section{Reproducibility Statement}\nThe ensure reproducibility of our work, we plan to release the following items:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Distilled video captions with corresponding frames.\n    \\item The model weights including the pre-trained, SFT, and DPO models.\n    \\item Code for training and testing using existing and our proposed benchmark.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\clearpage\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 1>\n\n<paper 2>\n\\title{ShareGPT4Video: Improving Video Understanding and Generation with Better Captions}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\vspace{-30pt}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.99\\linewidth]{figures/files/teaser.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Details and attributes of the ShareGPT4Video.} (a) The proposed ShareGPT4Video dataset contains a large volume of high-quality video-caption pairs collected from diverse sources, with 40K captions from GPT4V and 4.8M captions from our ShareCaptioner-Video.\n    (b) We illustrate in detail the process of harnessing the multi-modal image model GPT4V \\cite{gpt4v} to generate high-quality captions for videos.

All the models, strategies, and annotations\\footnote{We do not hold the copyright for any video and will provide the link-annotation pair for research-only usage.} will be open-sourced and we hope this project can serve as a pivotal resource for advancing both the LVLMs and T2VMs community.\n\n \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\nRecent advancements in multi-modal learning, driven by large language models, have led to progress in image-text dialogue\\cite{liu2023improved,chen2023sharegpt4v,dong2024internlm,wang2023cogvlm,ye2023mplug,chen2023internvl,bai2023qwenvl,young2024yi} and text-to-image generation tasks\\cite{betker2023improving,rombach2022high,chang2023muse,ruiz2023dreambooth,zhang2023adding,chen2023pixart}. This has inspired a shift towards video understanding\\cite{lin2023video,ataallah2024minigpt4,li2023llama,zhang2023video,maaz2023video,luo2023valley} and generation tasks\\cite{singer2022make,hong2022cogvideo,wu2023tune,wang2023lavie,blattmann2023stable,liu2024sora}, allowing for user interaction across video and language modalities. \nThus, the detailed and high-fidelity video captions, which bridge the aforementioned modalities, is instrumental in propelling the advancements within the field.\n\nDespite the rich semantic and temporal content of videos, they are often paired with brief captions in existing data. These short descriptions limit the detailed video understanding and the controllability of the video generation. While the importance of detailed captions is recognized in image-text dialogue\\cite{chen2023sharegpt4v,chen2024allava,wang2023see} and text-to-image generation tasks\\cite{chen2023pixart,dalle3}, similar efforts are lacking in video understanding and generation.\n\nHowever, creating large-scale, high-quality video captions is a challenging task. Detailed captioning for long videos is non-trivial and time-consuming even for humans, hindering large-scale annotation. Current open-source LVLMs lack this capability, and closed-source APIs do not yet support video inputs. \n\nOn the other hand, if we roughly degrade the input from video to multiple frames, even GPT4V struggles to describe the video with satisfied quality. For example, an intuitive idea is to provide multiple frames with timestamps to the GPT4V and generate the caption, while we find that GPT4V is unstable and sometimes misunderstands the temporal relation between the frames, and its performance further degrades with the increasing of video frame number. Other solutions such as concatenating all the frames into a large image are nonhelpful to the temporal problem, and the caption loses details as the frame number increases. We also showcase these problems in Figure~\\ref{fig:caption_strategy_2}-\\ref{fig:caption_strategy_3}\n\nWe posit that the challenge of devising an effective video captioning strategy is rooted in three fundamental aspects:\n\\textit{1) Inter-frame precise temporal change understanding}: The temporal dimension distinguishes videos from images. An imprecise temporal description can significantly diminish the quality of the video caption and lead to confusion in the training models.\n\\textit{2) Intra-frame detailed content description}: Detailed descriptions~\\cite{chen2023sharegpt4v} are crucial for aligning modalities between image and text, which are also important for video-text alignment.\n\\textit{3) Frame-number scalability for arbitrary-length videos}: Videos encountered in the wild can vary greatly in length. An ideal captioning strategy should be resilient to this variability and generate appropriate captions for videos of any length.\n\nTo this end, we present the \\textbf{Differential Sliding-Window Captioning strategy} (DiffSW), which is \\textit{stable, scalable, and efficient for generating captions for arbitrary videos.} The central concept of DiffSW is translating the all-frames-to-caption task into a differential description task. Specifically, we generate a detailed caption for the first frame and apply a sliding window of length two to the subsequent frames in chronological order. The powerful image multi-modal model, GPT4V \\cite{gpt4v}, is tasked with identifying the changes between frames based on three inputs: the previous frame, its differential caption, and the current frame. This encompasses alterations in camera movement, object movement, character actions, and scene transitions. Upon acquiring all differential captions, these are input into GPT4 \\cite{chatgpt} to construct a comprehensive caption for the entire video.\nThe differential concept allows DiffSW to concentrate on the changes between frames, i.e., the temporal changes. Its sliding design ensures the correctness of temporal order and invariance towards the total number of frames. The constant input frame number guarantees that GPT4V does not overlook details and utilizes the API efficiently, resulting in stable, scalable, and efficient caption quality from DiffSW. Furthermore, the differential design enables the re-caption of any sub-clips of a captioned video by reusing its differential captions.\n\nBased on DiffSW, we construct \\textbf{ShareGPT4Video}, which contains \\textbf{40K high-quality video-caption pairs} spanning a wide range of categories, and the resulting captions encompass rich world knowledge, object attributes, camera movements, and crucially, detailed and precise temporal descriptions of events. \nThe videos of ShareGPT4Video are collected from various sources \\cite{chen2024panda,yu2020bdd100k,pexels,grauman2022ego4d,pixabay,mixkit}, employed with a Semantic-based Data Filtering strategy to mitigate content homogeneity among these videos.  A Semantic-aware Key-frame Extraction strategy is then applied to the videos to reduce the temporal redundancy. DiffSW is applied to the keyframes to generate high-quality captions and we further improve its stability and quality with a Hierarchical Prompt Design. Manual quality inspection is employed to ensure the quality of the video captions.\n\nBased on ShareGPT4Video, we present ShareCaptionor-Video, an exceptional video captioner capable of efficiently generating high-quality captions for videos of a wide range of resolution, aspect ratio, and duration. It enables the further scaling of high-quality video caption data with minor cost and satisfactory quality, and we generate high-quality captions for 4.8M aesthetically appealing videos (totaling about 3000 hours) by it. \n \n\nWe conduct extensive experiments in video understanding and generation tasks to demonstrate the value of our high-quality video-caption dataset and our superior video captioner. \nFor video generation, a DiT-based \\cite{peebles2023scalable} text-to-video model trained on the 4.8M video-captions pairs performs well in generating 10-second high-resolution videos and achieving fine-grained control over content generation.\nFor video understanding, ShareGPT4Video brings consistent performance gain of multiple current LVLMs over multiple benchmarks by replacing a small proportion of training data. We further present ShareGPT4Video-8B, a simple yet superb LVLM that reached SOTA performance on three advancing and comprehensive video benchmarks. The model, strategy, and annotations will be publicly available and we hope this project can serve as a pivotal resource for advancing both the LVLMs and T2VMs community.\n\n\\section{ShareGPT4Video Dataset}\nThis section provides a detailed exposition of how we construct the ShareGPT4Video dataset. We detail the entire process in Figure \\ref{fig:pipeline1}. In Section \\ref{sec:data_source}, we describe our methods for collecting and filtering video data. In Section \\ref{sec:processing}, we explain how we perform efficient sparse sampling of the videos. In Section \\ref{sec:captioning}, we detail of how we leverage the multimodal image model GPT-4V to generate high-quality captions for the videos.\n\n\\subsection{Data Collection}\n\\label{sec:data_source}\n\\textbf{Selection of Data Sources.} To serve both video understanding and video generation tasks, we consider the aesthetic quality and content complexity of videos during our collection process. We first consider Panda-70M \\cite{chen2024panda}, a high-resolution video dataset sourced from YouTube, featuring clips ranging in one minute. This open-domain source covers diverse areas such as wildlife, cooking, sports, news \\& TV shows, gaming \\& 3D rendering. It typically includes complex content and transitions, providing a solid foundation for understanding various real-world scenarios. However, the complexity of these contents and transitions presents a significant challenge for the video generation field. To address this, we also source a large volume of aesthetically appealing videos from some user-uploaded video websites \\cite{pexels,pixabay,mixkit}. These videos predominantly consist of scenic views and aesthetically pleasing human activities, involving fewer transitions and simpler events.\nFinally, we supplement our collection with selected videos from Ego4D \\cite{grauman2022ego4d} and BDD100K \\cite{yu2020bdd100k} to fill the gaps in ego-centric human activities and auto-driving scenarios, ensuring our video sources encompass as many real-world scenes as possible. \n\n\\textbf{Semantic-Based Data Filtering.} Although our captioning method can support videos of extended lengths, our collection primarily focuses on videos shorter than two minutes due to the trade-off of the duration and amount of videos. We initially filter out videos from our selected data sources longer than two minutes, leaving videos in two minutes as the candidates. We then introduce a semantic-based data filtering strategy to mitigate content homogeneity among these candidates and maintain diversity in the final video dataset. This approach aims to select videos with significant thematic differences from the pool of candidates to compose our final video collection.\nSpecifically, we first use the Panda-Student \\cite{chen2024panda} model to generate a short caption with one sentence for each candidate video, and then maintain a final pool of video candidates. Whenever a new video $V$ is processed, we encode its corresponding short caption $S$ using the Bert-Base-Uncased \\cite{devlin2018bert} language model to obtain the \\texttt{CLS} token $P_{n+1} \\in {\\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times D}}$, which captures high-level semantic expressions. We then calculate the similarity between this \\texttt{CLS} token $P_{n+1}$ and the \\texttt{CLS} tokens $\\left\\{ {{P_1},{P_2}, \\ldots ,{P_n}} \\right\\}$ of videos already in the final candidate pool. A new video will only be added to the pool if its maximum similarity is below a predefined threshold. We provide the pseudo-code in Figure \\ref{fig:code1}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.99\\linewidth]{figures/files/pipeline_2.pdf}\n    \\captionsetup{font={footnotesize}}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Pipeline for generating high-quality video-caption data.}\n    We begin by selecting diverse video sources based on aesthetic quality and content complexity. Next, we use semantic-based data filtering to prevent content homogenization. We then apply semantic-aware key-frame extraction for sparse sampling, maintaining significant semantic variations. Finally, we implement a differential sliding-window captioning strategy, utilizing GPT-4V to generate detailed and temporally rich captions.\n    }\n    \\label{fig:pipeline1}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\subsection{Video Processing}\n\\label{sec:processing}\nVideos are commonly redundant on the temporal dimension, and keyframe sampling is a general idea to represent a video compactly.  \nHowever, traditional key-frame extraction methods \\cite{zhuang1998adaptive,calic2002efficient} often struggle to ensure semantic coherence, leading to missing key-frames covering crucial changes and transitions. Consequently, we develop a semantic-aware key-frame extraction method that strikes a balance between reducing temporal redundancy and maintaining semantic coherence.\n\n\\textbf{Semantic-aware Key-frame Extraction.} \nWe denote ${V} \\in {\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times H \\times W \\times 3}}$ as a $T$ frame set sampled from a video with fixed 2-second intervals.\nWe calculate the keyframe set ${V'} \\in {\\mathbb{R}^{T' \\times H \\times W \\times 3}}$ that are sufficiently sparse yet comprehensively cover the evolution of events within the video that $T' < T$. We view the output \\texttt{CLS} token of the CLIP-Large image encoder \\cite{radford2021learning} as the global semantics of each frame and remove the adjacent frames that have a high semantic similarity. In practice, we initialize the keyframe set $V'$ with the first frame of $V$. For each frame in $V$, we calculate its semantic similarity $d$ with the latest keyframe in $V'$. If $d$ is lower than the pre-defined threshold, we view the frame as a keyframe and add it to the $V'$. If not, the frame is skipped as redundant. For completeness, the last frame of $V$ is always added in $V'$. We provide the pseudo-code in Figure \\ref{fig:code2}.\n\n\\subsection{Captioning Pipeline}\n\\label{sec:captioning}\nAs we mentioned in Section \\ref{sec:intro}, we find if we feed all the frames to the GPT4V directly, the GPT4V struggles to stably generate captions with the correct temporal relation between frames, and its performance further worsens with the frame number increasing. On the other hand, if we concatenate all the frames into a large image, the GPT4V loses more details with the increasing frame number, as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:caption_strategy_2}-\\ref{fig:caption_strategy_3}. \n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.99\\linewidth]{figures/files/pie-light.pdf}\n    \\captionsetup{font={footnotesize}}\n    \\vspace{-2mm}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Comprehensive video-caption dataset}: (a) The dataset covers a broad spectrum of content, including wildlife, cooking, sports, scenery, ego-centric human activities, auto-driving scenarios, etc. \n    (b) The dataset includes videos ranging from 2 seconds to 2 minutes in length.\n    (c) The captions primarily range from 200 to 400 words, providing rich temporal information that serves video understanding and generation tasks well.}\n    \\label{fig:data-pie}\n    \\vspace{-5mm}\n\\end{figure*}\\textbf{Differential Sliding-window Captioning.} \nTo this end, we develop a differential sliding-window captioning pipeline to generate high-quality captions with detailed temporal descriptions for various videos. Specifically, the input fed to the image multi-modal model each time includes the current key-frame and the previous key-frame along with its differential caption. Then, we introduce the Differential Prompt to guide GPT4V in focusing on the changes between the current and previous frames, such as posture, position, camera angle, etc. Additionally, incorporating the differential caption of the previous frame as supplementary context enhances the response quality and reduces hallucinations. This is because the image embedding and textual caption provide explicit and implicit representations of the image, respectively. The differential caption not only adds extra context but also integrates temporal information from two frames ago, further improving the model's temporal understanding. It's important to note that for the first key-frame, which lacks a preceding frame, its differential caption is replaced directly with the standard caption. Finally, we input all differential captions along with their corresponding timestamps into GPT4. A specific Summary Prompt is designed to instruct the LLM to generate high-quality video captions with precise temporal dynamics and detailed spatial information. In practice, we use \\texttt{GPT-4-Turbo-04-09} for all the annotations.\n\nIn the design of the prompts, we discovered that an explicit Hierarchical Prompt Design significantly aids the GPT4V in comprehending its role, its expected format, and its operational boundaries. This approach contributes to the stabilization of the output’s format and enhances the overall quality of the results. For more details, please refer to Section \\ref{sec:app_prompt_design}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/files/captioner.pdf}\n    \\captionsetup{font={footnotesize}}\n    \\caption{The ShareCaptioner-Video is a Four-in-One exceptional video captioning model with the following capabilities: Fast captioning, Sliding Captioning, Clip Summarizing, and Prompt Re-Captioning.}\n    \\label{fig:captioner}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\section{ShareCaptioner-Video}\n\\subsection{Model design}\nWe fine-tune the IXC2-4KHD \\cite{dong2024internlm4k} using the collected video caption data, resulting in our ShareCaptioner-Video. For flexible usage, we re-organize the data for the following capabilities: \n\n\\noindent\\textbf{1. Fast Captioning} The model employs an image-grid format for direct video captioning, providing rapid generation speeds that are ideal for short videos. In practice, we concatenate all the keyframes of a video into a vertically elongated image and train the model on a caption task.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{2. Sliding Captioning} The model supports streaming captioning in a differential sliding-window format, yielding high-quality captions that are suitable for long videos. Similar to the captioning pipeline used in Section \\ref{sec:captioning}, we take the two adjacent keyframes alongside the previous differential caption as input, and train the model to describe the events occurring between them.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{3. Clip Summarizing} The model can swiftly summarize any clip from ShareGPT4Video or videos that have undergone the differential sliding-window captioning process, eliminating the need to re-process frames. We use all the differential descriptions as input, and the output is the video caption.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{4. Prompt Re-Captioning:} The model can rephrase prompts input by users who prefer specific video generation areas, ensuring that T2VMs trained on high-quality video-caption data maintain format alignment during inference with their training. In practice, we use GPT-4 to generate Sora-style prompts for our dense captions, and we train the re-captioning task in reverse, \\textit{i.e.}, by using the generated prompt as input and the dense caption as the training target.  \n\nIn practice, we fine-tune the model end-to-end over one epoch. We follow the default high-resolution strategy, using ‘HD-55’ for fast captioning and ‘HD-25’ for the others. The learning rate is uniform across all model components and warms up from 0 to $2.5\\times 10^{-5}$ within the first 1\\% of steps. The batch size is set to $1024$, and we sample the data uniformly.\n\n\\subsection{Scaling-up Captions}\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of our ShareCaptioner-Video in the video captioning task and further support the development of the video generation domain, we utilized it to annotate a large volume of aesthetically appealing videos. Specifically, we meticulously collect and process 4.8 million video clips, totaling approximately 3000 hours, from three sources: MixKit \\cite{mixkit}, Pexels \\cite{pexels}, and Pixabay \\cite{pixabay}. Subsequently, we employ the sliding captioning mode of ShareCaptioner-Video to generate high-quality captions for these videos. The total captioning process requires approximately 4000 H100 GPU hours. We provide some statistics on generated captions in Figure \\ref{fig:asthetic}.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\subsection{Video Understanding}\n\\textbf{Datasets and Benchmarks.}\nTo thoroughly explore the benefits that our high-quality video-caption data bring to LVLMs, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of the model across three multi-modal video benchmarks. VideoBench \\cite{ning2023video} curates approximately 15,000 QA pairs spanning 10 evaluation dimensions from 13 existing data sources, such as MSVD-QA \\cite{xu2017video}, MSRVTT-QA \\cite{xu2017video}, Activitynet-QA \\cite{yu2019activitynet}, etc. MVBench \\cite{li2023mvbench} is designed to challenge LVLMs with video tasks that cannot be effectively resolved by single-frame reliance, featuring 4,000 QA pairs derived from 11 public video benchmarks. TempCompass \\cite{liu2024tempcompass} specifically assesses the nuanced performance of LVLMs across various temporal aspects, such as speed, direction, and attribute changes. It includes 410 videos and 7,540 meticulously collected instructions, emphasizing temporal comprehension and interaction.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{minipage}[h]{0.45\\textwidth}\n        \\centering\n        \\captionsetup{font={scriptsize}}\n        \\captionof{table}{\\textbf{The gain from high-quality captions is universal among model architectures and scales.} We report the baseline based on their public checkpoints.

As shown in Table \\ref{tab:ablation1}, ShareGPT4Video consistently improves the alignment between video and language modalities in different LVLM architectures and scales. Specifically, VideoLLaVA-7B \\cite{lin2023video} achieves an average performance gain of 1.1 across three comprehensive multi-modal video benchmarks after integrating high-quality captions, while LLaMA-VID-7B and LLaMA-VID-13B achieve an average gain of 2.0 and 2.3, separately. Our high-quality video-caption data is particularly effective in helping LVLMs achieve significant performance improvements on benchmarks that require complex temporal understanding, such as TempCompass \\cite{liu2024tempcompass}. \n\n\\textbf{ShareGPT4Video-8B.}\nTo obtain our final ShareGPT4Video-8B model, we start with the LLaVA-Next-8B \\cite{li2024llavanext-strong} image multi-modal model. Consistent with previous LVLM approaches \\cite{lin2023video,maaz2023video}, we uniformly sample 16 frames from each video and arrange these frames into a 4x4 image grid to form the input for both training and inference, following the IG-VLM \\cite{kim2024image} strategy. For training data, we first collect 153K VQA data from various instructional video-to-text datasets to build our baseline. This collection includes 13K conversational data from VideoChatGPT \\cite{maaz2023video} and 140K question-answer pairs, with 45K data points from CLEVRER \\cite{yi2019clevrer}, 8K from EGO-QA \\cite{grauman2022ego4d}, 34K from NextQA \\cite{xiao2021next}, and 53K from TGIF-Transition \\cite{li2016tgif}. Then, these VQA data are combined with 28K video-caption data, forming a consolidated training dataset of 181K samples. For more training details, please refer to Section \\ref{sec:app_exp}.\n\nAs illustrated in Table \\ref{tab:tempcompass}, \\ref{tab:vbench}, \\ref{tab:mvbench}, we present a quantitative comparison between our ShareGPT4Video-8B model supercharged by our ShareGPT4Video dataset with existing state-of-the-art LVLMs. Notably, compared with previous LVLMs, our ShareGPT4Video-8B attains the most superior performance in all three comprehensive benchmarks.  \nSpecifically, thanks to the rich temporal information provided by ShareGPT4Video, our ShareGPT4Video-8B model achieves an impressive average accuracy of 61.5\\% on the TempCompass benchmark. This is an 11.6\\% increase over the previous best-performing LVLM, VideoLLaVA-7B. \nAdditionally, despite the VideoBench and MVBench benchmarks collecting a diverse range of QA data from various existing video datasets, we achieve solid performance on these benchmarks, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by an average accuracy of 2.7\\% and 8.2\\%. \n\n\\textbf{Abaltion on caption quality and ViT.}\nBased on ShareGPT4Video-8B, we study how the modality alignment is influenced by caption quality and learnable vision encoder. As indicated in Table \\ref{tab:ablation2}, introducing short captions on top of VQA data may not yield substantial performance gains. It could even degrade performance on some benchmarks due to sub-optimal modality alignment. Comparing the first, second, and fourth rows of Table \\ref{tab:ablation2}, the significant performance gains of comprehending temporal sequences benefited from our high-quality caption data are evident.

Following the process outlined in the Open-Sora-Plan \\cite{pku_yuan_lab_and_tuzhan_ai_etc_2024_10948109}, we fine-tuned the pretrained T2VM to enable the generation of high-fidelity 10-second videos.

Audio information is beneficial in conversational scenarios involving daily human activities. We plan to introduce audio information in future work, once GPT4o supports audio input, to enhance the quality of our captions further.\n\n\\textbf{Social impacts.} 1)Since the large language model involves the generation process of the large-scale captions, we have not manually verified each caption for socially biased content; 2) Although we utilize video data from existing public datasets, we cannot ensure that the selected videos do not contain human faces. Therefore, while there are no restrictions on the use of our generated captions, users must adhere to the licenses of the original video sources when using the videos.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIn this study, we aim to address the challenge of lacking high-quality video-caption data for large video-language models (LVLMs) and text-to-video models (T2VMs). We develop ShareGPT4Video, a high-quality video-caption dataset, and ShareCaptioner-Video, an advanced and versatile model in the video-language multi-modal area. By employing a series of strategies and designs, we generate 40K detailed captions from advanced image multi-modal model, GPT4V, and 4.8M high-quality captions from our ShareCaptioner-Video. These captions include rich world knowledge, object attributes, camera movements, and detailed temporal descriptions of events. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our dataset and captioner in enhancing video understanding and generation tasks. We believe that ShareGPT4Video and ShareCaptioner-Video will serve as essential resources for advancing research in the LVLM and T2VM communities.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 2>\n\n<paper 3>\n\\title{Video Instruction Tuning with Synthetic Data}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\renewcommand{\\thefootnote}{\\fnsymbol{footnote}}\n\\footnotetext{$\\heartsuit$ Work collaborated with ByteDance;~$\\P$ Co-senior authors}\n\\renewcommand{\\thefootnote}{\\arabic{footnote}}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nThe development of video large multimodal models (LMMs) has been hindered by the difficulty of curating large amounts of high-quality raw data from the web.

A significant recent advancement was introduced by visual instruction tuning~\\citep{liu2024visual}, which laid the foundation for building a general-purpose visual assistant. Notably, it proposed a data generation pipeline to create high-quality image-language instruction-following data. This pipeline has inspired subsequent researches~\\citep{li2024llavaonevision,li2024llavanext-strong,li2024llavanext-ablations,lin2024vila} aimed at generating diverse image-language instruction data across various visual domains, accelerating the development of visual instruction tuning techniques.\n\nCompared to the construction of image-language instruction-following data, obtaining high-quality video-language instruction-following data is challenging~\\citep{damonlpsg2023videollama,li2024videochatchatcentricvideounderstanding}. First, sourcing high-quality videos is difficult. We need to find videos with significant temporal changes that provide more knowledge than what image-language data can offer. However, we have found that most videos in current video-language instruction-following datasets~\\citep{chen2024sharegpt4video,zhang2024direct} are relatively static. Additionally, these videos are mostly trimmed based on scene changes, resulting in simplified plots. Such simplified video-language instruction-tuning data is inadequate for models to understand videos with complex narratives. Furthermore, current video-language instruction-following datasets often use a very sparse sampling rate for frame annotation. For instance, ShareGPT4Video~\\citep{chen2024sharegpt4video} has an average sampling rate of 0.15, sometimes sampling only 2 frames from a 30-second video. \nThis sparse sampling rate is effective in describing overall scenes but fails to capture detailed movements or changes in the video, resulting in hallucination  when detailed descriptions of the video are required.\n\nTo overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a comprehensive video instruction-tuning dataset named~\\DataName, consisting of 178,510 videos ranging from 0 to 3 minutes. This dataset is enriched with detailed annotations, open-ended questions, and multiple-choice questions, developed through a combination of GPT-4o~\\citep{openai2024gpt4o} and human efforts. It features four favorable properties: \\textbf{$(i)$ Extensive Video Source:} We conduct a comprehensive survey on the video sources of exsiting video understanding datasets, and conclude 10 major video data sources, from which we start our video data collection by building a video pool.\nAlthough there are over 40 video-language datasets, their video data are mainly sourced from 10 datasets~\\citep{Zhou2017YouCookIID,xue2022hdvila,goyal2017something,caba2015activitynet,kay2017kinetics,sigurdsson2016charades,wang2023internvid,shang2019vidor,grauman2022ego4d,zhu2023languagebind}, covering a wide range of video domains, such as activities, cooking, TV shows, and egocentric views.  \\textbf{$(ii)$ Dynamic Untrimmed Video Selection:} From these sources, we use several filtering logic to select the most dynamic videos from the video data pool. Notably, we select original, untrimmed videos to ensure plot completeness. \\textbf{$(iii)$ Recurrent Detailed Caption Generation Pipeline with Dense Frame Sampling:} We propose a detailed video caption pipeline that operates recurrently, enabling us to generate detailed captions for videos of any length. This pipeline has three levels, each level of description represents a different time-range: from 10 seconds to the entire video length. It is recurrent as the historical description from any level serves as the context for generating new descriptions at any level. Additionally, we adopted a dense sampling strategy of one frame per second to ensure the sampled frames are rich enough to represent the videos. \\textbf{$(iv)$ Diverse Tasks:} Based on the detailed video descriptions, we can generate question-answer pairs. To ensure our questions cover a wide range of scenarios, by referring to the video question-answering dataset, we define 16 question types. We prompt GPT-4o to generate question-answer pairs by referring to these question types, covering open-ended and multi-choice questions.\n\nBased upon the~\\DataName~dataset, we developed~\\ModelName. Contrary to previous studies suggesting that training with single frames is sufficient for video-language understanding~\\citep{lei2022revealing}, our findings reveal a significant impact of frame count on~\\ModelName's performance, attributable to the detailed features of~\\DataName. Observing this, we explored maximizing frame sampling within the constraints of limited GPU memory. We introduce~\\MethodName, a video representation technique that optimally distributes visual tokens across different frames. This approach allows for incorporating up to three times more frames than traditional methods, which allocate an equal number of visual tokens to each frame.\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=7.5mm]\n\\setlength{\\itemsep}{2pt}\n\\item {\\it Video-language Instruction-Following Data}: We present a high-quality dataset \\textit{\\DataName} tailored for video instruction-following. It consists of 178K video with 1.3M instruction samples, including detailed captions, free-form and multiple-choice question answering.\n\n\\item {\\it Video Large Multimodal Models}: We develop \\textit{\\ModelName}, a series of advanced large video-language models that expand the capabilities of open models in understanding video content.\n\n\\item {\\it Open-Source}: In an effort to support the development of general-purpose visual assistants, we release our multimodal instruction data, codebase, model checkpoints, and a visual chat demo to the public.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\section{Related Work}\n\nIn this work, our goal is to create a high-quality video-language dataset that goes beyond simple video captions. We aim to improve the ability to follow instructions, which includes detailed video descriptions, open-ended video question-answering, and multiple-choice video question-answering data. We discuss related datasets in Table~\\ref{tab:dataset_comparison}. Previous video-language datasets~\\citep{miech19howto100m} include manually annotated data for various tasks, such as video captions~\\citep{chen2011msvd,xu2016msrvtt,rohrbach2015LSMDC,anne2017didemo,caba2015activitynet,Zhou2017YouCookIID}, and video question-answering~\\citep{yu2019activityqa,zadeh2019social,xiao2021next}. However, manual annotation is expensive and limits the size of such datasets. To address the shortage of data, studies like~\\citep{miech19howto100m,lee2021acav100m,zellers2021merlot,xue2022hdvila} suggest automatically annotating data using subtitles created by ASR. While this method greatly expands the dataset size to 100 million samples, the subtitles often fail to accurately describe the main video content. Additionally, other studies~\\citep{xu2017msvdqa,grunde2021agqa,wu2024star} use language models~\\citep{xu2017msvdqa} or question templates~\\citep{grunde2021agqa,wu2024star} to generate question-answer pairs. Although this approach can generate a large number of questions and answers, it often produces poor-quality questions that do not reflect real-world user inquiries. More recent research~\\citep{chen2024panda70m} has prompted video-language models such as BLIP-2~\\citep{li2023blip2bootstrappinglanguageimagepretraining}, VideoChat~\\citep{li2024videochatchatcentricvideounderstanding}, Video-LLaMA~\\citep{damonlpsg2023videollama}, and MiniGPT-4~\\citep{zhu2023minigpt} to generate video captions. However, these models are limited in their ability to provide detailed descriptions. \n\nThe most related works to ours are the recent AI-generated synthetic video instruction tuning data, LLaVA-Hound~\\citep{zhang2024direct} and ShareGPT4Video~\\citep{chen2024sharegpt4video}, where they have used GPT-4~\\citep{openai2023gpt4v} to generate video captions and open-ended video question-answering. Although the quality of the captions and question-answer pairs has significantly improved, the video sources they use are too static to produce high-quality data for instruction-following scenarios. They also only use very sparse frames for prompting GPT-4V, which results in annotations that fail to capture nuanced actions and continuous plots in the videos. Additionally, Shot2Story~\\citep{han2023shot2story20k} and Vript~\\citep{han2023shot2story20k} also employ GPT-4V~\\citep{openai2023gpt4v} for video captioning. Their outputs, however, include audio details, which are outside the scope of this study.\n\n\\section{Video Instruction-Following Data Synthesis}\n\\label{sec:dataset}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{figures/video_data_source.pdf}\n\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Video sources in the proposed \\textit{\\DataName{}}}.

We identify a key factor in building such datasets: ensuring richness and diversity in both video content and its language annotations. We perform comprehensive survey on the existing video benchmarks, covering across various public video captioning and question-answering datasets, then identify ten unique video sources that contribute to over 40 video-language benchmarks. From each source, we select videos that exhibit significant temporal dynamics. To maintain diversity in the annotations, we establish a pipeline capable of generating detailed captions for videos of any length. Additionally, we define 16 types of questions that guide GPT-4o in creating question-answer pairs to assess the perceptual and reasoning skills of the video-language models.\n\n\\subsection{Video source}\n\\label{sec:dataset;subsec:datasource}\nOne important starting point in building a high-quality video instruction-following dataset is to find a sufficiently diverse pool of video data. From this pool, we can select the qualified videos. In our study of public video-language datasets---including video captioning, video question answering, video summarization, and moment-wise captioning---we noticed that although different datasets focus on various video understanding tasks (\\eg, AGQA~\\citep{grunde2021agqa} for spatial-temporal relations and STAR~\\citep{wu2024star} for situational reasoning), most are sourced from ten main video sources. For instance, both AGQA and STAR use data from Charades~\\citep{sigurdsson2016charades}. Specifically, these ten sources are HD-VILA-100M~\\citep{xue2022hdvila}, InternVid-10M~\\citep{wang2023internvid}, VidOR~\\citep{shang2019vidor}, VIDAL (YouTube Shorts)\\citep{zhu2023languagebind}, YouCook2\\citep{Zhou2017YouCookIID}, Charades~\\citep{sigurdsson2016charades}, ActivityNet~\\citep{caba2015activitynet}, Kinetics-700~\\citep{kay2017kinetics}, Something-Something v2~\\citep{goyal2017something}, and Ego4d~\\citep{grauman2022ego4d}. These sources offer a wide range of video data from different websites, viewpoints, and domains. The relationship between these ten selected video datasets and others is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:video_data_source}. The videos from this ten datsets build the video pool for the further video selection.  Notably, we use untrimmed videos from each source except for YouCook2 and Kinetics-700. We believe that cutting videos into clips can break the plot continuity, which is essential for understanding the videos.\n\nBased on the video pool, we aim to select dynamic videos. In Figure~\\ref{fig:video_data_source}, we outline our criteria for selecting high-quality data. Our main method for identifying dynamic content involves using PySceneDetect, which calculates the number of scenes in a video\nWe found that the number of scenes is a good indicator of video dynamism. Additionally, we have designed a specific approach~\\ding{175} to exclude videos that mainly contain ``slides.\"\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{figures/llava_video_data_creation.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textbf{The video detail description creation pipeline}. A three-level creation pipeline is considered, with each level developed via a recurrent approach. \nNote that $t$ is the index of time internal at its own level, and $T$ is the last time internal index. \n(a) To generate the caption for time internal $t$ at level-1, we condition on the current frames in this internal, the caption for time internal $t-1$, and the most recent description summary at level-2 if applicable. \n(b) To generate caption for time internal $t$ at level-2, we condtion on the previous caption at level-2, and captions from three most recent time internals at level-1.\n(c) To generate the overall caption at the last time internal $T$ at level-3, we condtion on the the most recent caption at level-2 and the current caption from level-1.\n}\n\\label{fig:data_generation}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Video Detail Description}\n\\label{sec:dataset;subsec:video_detail_description}\n\\paragraph{Automated Generation}\nFor selected videos, we use GPT-4o~\\citep{openai2024gpt4o} to systematically describe their content. We start by sampling video frames at one frame per second (fps). However, due to the input size constraints of GPT-4o, we cannot use all sampled frames. Instead, we describe the videos sequentially, as shown in Fig~\\ref{fig:data_generation}. We create descriptions at three distinct levels, detailed below.\n\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=7.5mm]\n\\setlength{\\itemsep}{2pt}\n\\item {\\it Level-1 Description}: Every 10 seconds, we provide a level-1 description that outlines the events in that segment. This description considers: frames from the current clip and historical context, which includes all recent level-1 descriptions not yet summarized into a level-2 description and the latest level-2 description.\n\n\\item {\\it Level-2 Description}: Every 30 seconds, we creat a level-2 summary of the entire video plot up to that point. This is based on the last three level-1 descriptions, covering the most recent 30 seconds; and the latest level-2 description.\n\n\\item {\\it Level-3 Description}: At the video's end, we generate a level-3 description to encapsulate the entire video. The inputs for this description are the recent level-1 descriptions not yet summarized, covering the last moments of the plot after the recent summary; and the latest level-2 description.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{figures/question_type.pdf}\n    \\caption{Question types for video question answering in data creation. For each type, we provide its name and an example question.}\n \\label{fig:question_type}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Video Question Answering}\n\\paragraph{Question Type definition}\nIn addition to detailed video descriptions, our dataset includes a variety of question-answer pairs designed for complex interactions. This setup improves the video understanding model's ability to handle real-life queries. We refer to public video question-answering benchmarks~\\citep{xiao2021next,yu2019activityqa,Khattak2024cvrres,liu2024tempcompass} to organize these questions into 16 specific categories, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:question_type}.\n\n\\paragraph{Automated Generation}\nGiven a detailed video description, we use GPT-4o to generate at most one question-answer pair for each type of question. The prompts include: (1) The task definition for the current question type. (2) In-context examples for this type, which include three video descriptions and their three question-answer pairs of this specific type. (3) The detailed video description for the current video.\nWe instruct GPT-4o to return \\textit{None} if it cannot generate question-answer pairs for a specific question type.\n\n\\paragraph{Filtering.}\nTo filter out the generated question-answer pairs, we apply the following strategy: (1) remove duplicates using the sentence-transformer~\\citep{reimers-2020-multilingual-sentence-bert}, (2) discard answers that begin with phrases like ``does not specify,'' ``does not mention,'' ``does not specifically,'' ``does not depict,'' or ``does not show.''\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{figures/llava_video_dataset_task.pdf}\n\\caption{One example to illustrate the video instruction-following data.}\n\\label{fig:annotation_example}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Dataset Statistics}\n\\paragraph{Overview.} \nWe carefully select from our collected data sources to form a balanced and comprehensive collection, resulting in a total of 178K videos and 1.3M instruction-following samples. This includes 178K captions, 960K open-ended QAs, and 196K multiple-choice QAs. \n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{minipage}[b]{0.95\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/ov_plot.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\n\\begin{minipage}[b]{0.95\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\tabstyle{2pt}\n\\fontsize{8pt}{10pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{tabular}{l|ccc||l|ccc}\n    \\midrule\n    \\textbf{Dataset} &\n    \\textbf{\\#Caption} &\n    \\textbf{\\#Open-Ended} &\n    \\textbf{\\#Multi-Choice} &\n    \\textbf{Dataset} &\n    \\textbf{\\#Caption} &\n    \\textbf{\\#Open-Ended} &\n    \\textbf{\\#Multi-Choice}\\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\makecell[l]{VidOR} &\n    \\tikz[baseline=0.05em] \\fill [color={rgb,255: red,229;

Figure~\\ref{fig:video_category} displays the distribution of ten uniformly sampled video categories, showcasing examples from four of these categories. Among all videos, ``comedy'' predominates, primarily because YouTube Shorts is one of the most common sources in our dataset.

In contrast, we carefully select video sources that offer dynamic, untrimmed videos with complex plots, which are crucial for developing a powerful video understanding model.\\footnote{Example videos: \\href{https://ak.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/21179416/preview/stock-footage-aerial-shot-winter-forest.mp4}{WebVid},\\href{https://pixabay.com/videos/plane-modelling-miniature-lockheed-134519/}{Pixabay},\\href{https://www.pexels.com/video/a-bird-is-standing-on-the-beach-27916646/}{Pexels},\\href{https://mixkit.co/free-stock-video/a-young-woman-clad-in-snugly-black-sportswear-doing-lunges-52112/}{Mixkit}.}\n$(ii)$ \\textit{High frames per second}. Regarding frame sampling in language annotations, the proposed datasest considers 1 FPS, while other datasets consider much lower FPS.  LLaVA-Hound uniformly samples 10 frames from videos of any length. The average FPS is 0.008, which may miss some fine details. ShareGPT4Video picks key frames using CLIP~\\citep{radford2021learning} based on frame uniqueness. This method might also miss subtle changes in the video because CLIP embeddings do not capture fine-grained dynamics well. Our method samples FPS=1 without using key frame selection algorithms, ensuring the detailed temproal information can be expressed in annotations and high coverage. \n$(iii)$   \\textit{Diverse tasks.} The proposed dataset considers three common task types, including caption, free-form and closed-form QA, while existing datasets only consider a subset. Meanwhile, the quality and numbers of samples in our dataset is higher.\n\n \n\n\\section{Experiments}\nWe conducted evaluations for the LLaVA-Video models across all benchmarks using LMMs-Eval~\\citep{zhang2024lmms} to ensure standardization and reproducibility. To fairly compare with other leading video LMMs, we primarily used results from original papers. When results were not available, we integrated the models into LMMs-Eval and assessed them under consistent settings. Following LLaVA-OneVision~\\citep{li2024llavaonevision}, we employed SigLIP~\\citep{zhai2023sigmoid} as our vision encoder, and Qwen2~\\citep{yang2024qwen2} as the LLM. The LLaVA-Video model builds on the single-image (SI) stage checkpoint from the LLaVA-OneVision model~\\citep{li2024llavaonevision}, which was trained using only image data. \n\n\\paragraph{Video Representations}\nFollowing the classic SlowFast idea in video representations~\\citep{feichtenhofer2019slowfast,xu2024slowfast,huang2024lita}, we develop \\textit{\\MethodName{}} to optimize the balance between the number of frames and the count of visual tokens, within the budget of the limited context window in LLM and GPU memory for video representation. Please refer to Appendix~\\ref{app:visual_representations} for detailed information. Specifically, we represent each video as a sequence with maximum $T$ frames. Each frame is represented in $M$ tokens. we categorize the frames into two groups, based on the a strike rate $s$, where the every $s$ frames are uniformly selected to form the \\textit{slow} frame group, and the rest of the frames are consdiered as the \\textit{fast} frame group. Note that a special case $s=1$ leads to only one group, reducing the SlowFast representation to the original simple representation. For each group, we apply different pooling rate using Pytorch function pooling $\\mathtt{avg\\_pool2d}()$.  $p \\times p$ pooling and $2p \\times 2p$ pooling for slow and fast frames, respectively. To summarize, we paramterize the video representation configuration as $\\Vcal = (T, M, s, p)$. The total number of tokens is \\(\n\\#tokens = \\left\\lfloor T/s \\right\\rfloor \\times \\left\\lfloor M/p^2 \\right\\rfloor + \\left( T - \\left\\lfloor T/s \\right\\rfloor \\right) \\times \\left\\lfloor M/p^2 \\right\\rfloor\n\\)\n\n\\paragraph{Evaluation Benchmarks.} For full evaluation, we consdier 11 video benchmarks. conducted tests across various video captioning , video open-ended question-answering and video multiple-choice question-answering benchmarks, including ActivityNet-QA~\\citep{yu2019activityqa}, which features human-annotated action-related QA pairs from the ActivityNet dataset. We also utilized LongVideoBench~\\citep{wu2024longvideobench}, EgoSchema \\citep{mangalam2024egoschema}, and MLVU~\\citep{zhou2024mlvu} for long video understanding, PerceptionTest~\\citep{patraucean2023perception} for assessing fine-grained perception skills, and VideoMME~\\citep{fu2024videomme} and NExT-QA~\\citep{xiao2021next} for diverse video domains and durations. Additional tests included VideoDetailCaption~\\citep{videodetail2024} Dream-1K~\\citep{wang2024tarsierrecipestrainingevaluating} for detailed video descriptions and Video-ChatGPT \\citep{Maaz2023VideoChatGPT} for visual chat.\n\nFor ablation studies in .~\\ref{sec;subsec:dataset_ablation} and Sec.~\\ref{sec;subsec:dataset_comparison}, we conduct evaluation across 4 datasets. NExT-QA~\\citep{xiao2021next} and PerceptionTest~\\citep{patraucean2023perception}, which use training data from the \\DataName{}, are treated as in-domain datasets. Conversely, VideoMME~\\citep{fu2024videomme} and EgoSchema~\\citep{mangalam2024egoschema} are considegreen zero-shot datasets. \n\n \\subsection{Overall Results}\n\nWe fine-tune LLaVA-OneVision (SI) on the joint dataset of video and image data. Specifically, we added video data from the \\DataName{} dataset and four public datasets: \nActivityNet-QA~\\citep{yu2019activityqa}, NExT-QA~\\citep{xiao2021next}, PerceptionTest~\\citep{patraucean2023perception}, and LLaVA-Hound-255K~\\citep{zhang2024direct}, focusing on videos shorter than three minutes. These datasets were selected to improve our model’s performance, contributing to a total of 1.6 million video-language samples, which include 193,510 video descriptions, 1,241,412 open-ended questions, and 215,625 multiple-choice questions. Remarkably, 92.2\\% of the video descriptions, 77.4\\% of the open-ended questions, and 90.9\\% of the multiple-choice questions were newly annotated. Additionally, we used 1.1 million image-language pairs from the LLaVA-OneVision model \\citep{li2024llavaonevision}. \nWe consider the same video representation configurations for the training and inference stages. On 128 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, the video representations for LLaVA-Video-7B and LLaVA-Video-72B are $\\Vcal = (64, 679, 1, 2)$ and $\\Vcal = (64, 679, 3, 2)$, respectively.\n\n \n\\begin{table}[t!]\n\\tabstyle{1pt}\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{\\ModelName{} performance on video benchmarks.

The 72B model performs as well as the commercial, closed-source model Gemini-1.5-Flash~\\citep{team2023gemini}, highlighting the effectiveness of open-source efforts in achieving comparable results. The \\ModelName{}-7B model outperforms the previous top model, LLaVA-OV-7B, in seven out of ten datasets. Analysis of individual datasets shows some noteworthy trends. For instance, on benchmarks like MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME, which primarily use video data from YouTube, this improvement may be due to the inclusion of extensive YouTube data in \\DataName{}, as illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ov_plot}. Additionally, the improvement on ActivityNet-QA is small; this could be because many questions in ActivityNet-QA, such as ``What’s the color of the ball?'' can be answered by viewing a single frame. The visibility of the ball from the beginning to the end of the video means understanding the video sequence is unnecessary, so \\DataName{} offers little advantage in this context.\nWe find that \\ModelName{}-7B is notably weaker in the specialized task of EgoSchema, an ego-centric dataset. This weakness may be due to a significant reduction in the proportion of ego-centric data in the training dataset of \\ModelName{}. However, this impact is less pronounced in larger models, as demonstrated by the \\ModelName{}-72B model's superior performance over LLaVA-OV-72B in EgoSchema.\n\n\\subsection{Dataset Ablation}\n\\label{sec;subsec:dataset_ablation}\nNote that the training set for \\ModelName{} includes six datasets: \\DataName{}, LLaVA-Hound~\\citep{zhang2024direct}, NExT-QA~\\citep{xiao2021next}, ActivityNet-QA~\\citep{yu2019activityqa}, PerceptionTest~\\citep{patraucean2023perception}, and image data from LLaVA-OneVision~\\citep{li2024llavaonevision}. In this section, we conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of each dataset. We separately fine-tune the LLaVA-OneVision (SI) model for each experimental setting, progressively adding datasets to the baseline. We use a video representation defined by $\\Vcal = (64, 679, 1, 2)$\n\nThe results are presented in Table~\\ref{tab:dataset_ablation}. Initially, we used a basic model trained solely on the LLaVA-Hound dataset as our baseline. Compared to this baseline, adding the \\DataName{} dataset significantly improved performance, enhancing scores in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Specifically, we observed a 31.9-point increase in NExT-QA scores and a 9.1-point rise in VideoMME scores. Furthermore, including the PerceptionTest dataset significantly enhanced its associated task. Additionally, integrating high-quality image data provided modest benefits on EgoSchema.\n\n\\begin{table}[t!]\n\\tabstyle{15pt}\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Ablation study on the \\ModelName{} model with various configurations of training data.

As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:dataset_comparison_exp}, we compared three datasets where the language annotations are from GPT-4V/GPT-4o. For each experiment, we fine-tune the LLaVA-OneVision (SI) model separately on each specific dataset setting, utilizing a video representation defined by $\\Vcal = (64, 679, 1, 2)$.\n\nTwo group of experiments are considered to assess the data quality of \\DataName{} compare to LLaVA-Hound and ShareGPT4Video. In the first group, to compare \\DataName{} with LLaVA-Hound, we randomly selected 900K open-ended questions to match the number in LLaVA-Hound. We included all captions and did not sample the multiple-choice questions. In the second group, comparing \\DataName{} to ShareGPT4Video, we randomly sampled 40K video captions to align with those in ShareGPT4Video. Since ShareGPT4Video lacks open-ended and multiple-choice questions, we supplemented with annotations from NExT-QA, PerceptionTest, and ActivityNet-QA. \nIn the first group of Table~\\ref{tab:dataset_comparison_exp}, we compare \\DataName{} with LLaVA-Hound. Although LLaVA-Hound has more captions than \\DataName{}, our results are still better. As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:dataset_comparison}, despite LLaVA-Hound annotates more videos, its quality is limited due to two main issues: (1) Static video: Its primary video source is WebVid~\\citep{Bain21}, which tends to have relatively static content. (2) Sparse sampling: Although it includes data sources with dynamic videos, its sampling rate of 10 frames per video leads to annotations that do not fully capture the complete plot of the video. This underscores that the quality of video instruction-following data is more important than its quantity. Additionally, the second experiment group in Table~\\ref{tab:dataset_comparison_exp} shows that the model trained with \\DataName{} outperforms that of ShareGPT4Video,  highlighting the superiority of our data's quality.\n\n\\begin{table}[t!]\n\\tabstyle{3pt}\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Comparison of \\DataName{} and other video instruction-following datasets.}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}llll|llll@{}}\n    \\toprule\n       & & & & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{in-domain} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{out-of-domain} \\\\   \n     &\n      \\multirow{3}{*}{\\textbf{\\#Caption}} &\n    \\multirow{3}{*}{\\textbf{\\#OE}} &\n    \\multirow{3}{*}{\\textbf{\\#MC}} &\n    \\textbf{NExT-QA} & \\textbf{PerceptionTest} & \n    \\textbf{EgoSchema} & \n    \\textbf{VideoMME} \\\\ \\cmidrule(l){5-8} \n      & &  &   & mc & val  & test & wo \\\\ \\midrule\n    LLaVA-Hound & 900K & 900k & 0 & 64.4 & 51.4 & 51.0 & 51.0 \\\\  \n    \\DataName{} & 178K & 900k & 0 & 73.2 \\textcolor{green}{\\scriptsize (+8.8)} & 55.9 \\textcolor{green}{\\scriptsize (+4.5)} & 49.8 \\textcolor{red}{\\scriptsize (-1.2)} & 59.6 \\textcolor{green}{\\scriptsize (+8.6)} \\\\\n  \\midrule\n    ShareGPT4Video & 40K & 40K & 19K & 69.6 & 55.2 & 58.9 & 51.0 \\\\  \n    \\DataName{} & 40K & 40K & 19K & 75.8 \\textcolor{green}{\\scriptsize (+6.2)} & 55.4 \\textcolor{green}{\\scriptsize (+0.2)} & 55.8 \\textcolor{red}{\\scriptsize (-3.1)} & 53.5 \\textcolor{green}{\\scriptsize (+2.5)} \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}%\n\\label{tab:dataset_comparison_exp}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThis study introduces the \\DataName{} dataset, a high-quality synthetic dataset for video-language instruction-following.

LMMs are designed to understand and interact with video data across various tasks, including video question answering (VQA), instruction-following, and generation. However, the development of these models faces several challenges, primarily related to the scarcity and quality of video data, the difficulty in generating informative feedback, and the presence of hallucinations in generated responses. Existing datasets often provide brief captions or sparse frame annotations, which are insufficient for training models that require detailed temporal understanding and complex narrative comprehension. This summary focuses on three recent papers that address these challenges by introducing novel approaches to enhance the performance of LMMs through detailed captions and synthetic data.\n\nHistorically, multimodal learning has been driven by advancements in both image-text and text-to-image tasks, with models like GPT-4V and GPT-4o playing a pivotal role. These models have been adapted to handle video content, but the complexity of video data, especially in terms of temporal dynamics, poses unique challenges. To mitigate these challenges, researchers have explored various methods, including reinforcement learning (RL) with human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, these methods often require extensive human effort and costly evaluations, which limit their scalability. The papers discussed here introduce innovative solutions to these challenges, aiming to improve the alignment and performance of LMMs in video understanding and generation tasks.\n\n### Main Content of Each Paper\n\n#### Paper 1: Direct Preference Optimization of Video Large Multimodal Models from Language Model Reward\nThis paper addresses the challenge of aligning LMMs with video instruction-following tasks, focusing on the issue of hallucinations in generated responses. It introduces a novel framework that utilizes detailed video captions as a proxy for video content, enabling language models to score video QA predictions based on these captions. The approach involves three main stages: caption distillation, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with video instruction data, and DPO training using the generated captions as supporting evidence. The authors develop a large-scale video caption dataset, \\datasetname, containing 900k captions that cover a wide range of video content, including temporal dynamics, world knowledge, object attributes, and spatial relationships. This dataset serves as a foundational resource for LMM model training and research. The paper demonstrates that the proposed reward mechanism, which uses video captions as a proxy, is well-aligned with evaluations from the more powerful but costlier \\gptv model. By employing this reward mechanism in the DPO algorithm, the authors train a model that achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement over the SFT counterpart, marking a significant advancement in video LMM alignment.\n\n#### Paper 2: ShareGPT4Video: Improving Video Understanding and Generation with Better Captions\nThis paper presents the ShareGPT4Video series, which includes a high-quality video caption dataset and a versatile video captioning model. The dataset, ShareGPT4Video, contains 40K high-quality video-caption pairs, while the captioning model, ShareCaptioner-Video, can generate captions for videos of varying lengths and complexities. The authors introduce a differential sliding-window captioning strategy (DiffSW) to generate captions that are detailed and temporally rich. This strategy involves generating a detailed caption for the first frame and applying a sliding window of length two to the subsequent frames, focusing on changes in camera movement, object movement, character actions, and scene transitions. The captions are then input into GPT-4 to construct a comprehensive caption for the entire video. The authors also develop ShareCaptioner-Video, which can generate captions for 4.8M aesthetically appealing videos, totaling about 3000 hours. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ShareGPT4Video in enhancing the performance of LVLMs across three comprehensive video benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and score metrics.\n\n#### Paper 3: Video Instruction Tuning with Synthetic Data\nThis paper introduces a synthetic dataset, \\DataName, specifically designed for video instruction-following tasks. The dataset includes 178K videos and 1.3M instruction samples, covering detailed captions, open-ended QAs, and multiple-choice QAs. The authors develop a video representation technique, \\MethodName, which optimally distributes visual tokens across different frames, allowing for the inclusion of up to three times more frames than traditional methods. The paper also presents \\ModelName, a series of advanced large video-language models that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various video benchmarks. The authors conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of their dataset and model, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and score metrics across multiple benchmarks. The study highlights the importance of high-quality video instruction-following data in enhancing the performance of LMMs.\n\n### Commonalities and Innovations\nAll three papers aim to enhance the performance of LMMs in video understanding and generation tasks. They share a common goal of improving the alignment between video content and language models, but each paper introduces unique methods to achieve this goal.\n\n- **Common Goal**: The papers focus on enhancing the performance of LMMs through detailed captions and instruction-following data. They all recognize the importance of high-quality video captions in improving the alignment between video content and language models.\n- **Innovations**:\n  - **Paper 1**: Introduces a novel reward mechanism using detailed video captions as a proxy for video content, enabling language models to score video QA predictions. It demonstrates the effectiveness of DPO in improving the alignment of video LMMs.\n  - **Paper 2**: Develops a differential sliding-window captioning strategy (DiffSW) to generate detailed and temporally rich captions for videos. It also introduces ShareCaptioner-Video, a model capable of generating high-quality captions for videos of varying lengths and complexities.\n  - **Paper 3**: Introduces a synthetic dataset, \\DataName, specifically designed for video instruction-following tasks.

They all recognize the importance of detailed captions and instruction-following data in improving the alignment between video content and language models. Paper 1 proposes a cost-effective reward mechanism using detailed video captions, demonstrating significant improvements in model performance through DPO. Paper 2 introduces a differential sliding-window captioning strategy (DiffSW) and a versatile captioning model (ShareCaptioner-Video) to generate high-quality captions for videos of varying lengths. Paper 3 presents a synthetic dataset (\\DataName) and a video representation technique (\\MethodName) to optimize the use of visual tokens and enhance the model's understanding of video content.\n\nThe results from these studies indicate that high-quality video captions and detailed instruction-following data are crucial for improving the performance of LMMs. The models trained with these approaches achieve SOTA performance on various video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Future research could explore the integration of audio information in video captioning, further scaling up the generation of high-quality captions, and refining the video representation techniques to better capture nuanced actions and continuous plots in videos.\n\n### Future Research Directions\n- **Audio Integration**: Incorporating audio information into video captioning could enhance the models' understanding of conversational scenarios and improve their alignment with real-world video content.\n- **Scalability**: Further scaling up the generation of high-quality captions and instruction-following data could enable more extensive training of LMMs and improve their generalization capabilities.\n- **Video Representation**: Refining the video representation techniques to better capture nuanced actions and continuous plots in videos could lead to more accurate and detailed model outputs.\n- **Cross-Modal Alignment**: Investigating methods to improve the alignment between video and language modalities could enhance the models' ability to handle complex video understanding and generation tasks.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, future research could further advance the capabilities of LMMs in video understanding and generation, potentially leading to more robust and versatile models that can handle a wide range of real-world scenarios."
