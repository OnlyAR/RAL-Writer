S/LLMs could detect insults, violence, and sexual content. \n  Subtler discourse--namely, microaggressions, bias, and identity attacks--were not easily detectable by any of the models.}\n  \\label{fig:cohen-kappa-prompt-polar}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are being adopted swiftly in research and production applications. \nHowever, their tendency to memorise content \\cite{carlini2022quantifying,PlagiariseLee,dewynter2023evaluation} and the fact that they are trained from publicly-available data means that they are very prone to spew harmful content \\cite{sheng-etal-2019-woman,wang2023decodingtrust,rauh2022characteristics,gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts}. \nWith the advent of more capable, multilingual LLMs such as GPT-4 \\cite{openai2024gpt4} or BLOOMZ \\cite{wang-etal-2020-multi}, toxic language detection must scale fast and effectively to the dozens, if not hundreds, of languages these models support.\n\nLLMs and their more-portable, typically-open-source counterparts, \\emph{small} language models (SLMs) have been used as annotators for some tasks with good results \\cite{rethinkingsemantic,NEURIPS2023_91f18a12}. \nHowever, it remains unclear if S/LLMs can successfully annotate data in a culturally-sensitive multilingual scenario when harmful content is involved. \nThis is important for content moderation, but also raises questions about the models' multilingual reasoning capabilities within a culture-specific context.\n\n\\subsection{Contributions}\nTo address whether S/LLMs can annotate and reason over toxic, culturally-specific content, we introduce \\textbf{a multilingual corpus in 28 languages}, RTP-LX (``RTP-Language eXpanded''). \nIt is comprised of about $1,100$ toxic prompts and outputs per language, and derived from the RTP dataset (``Real Toxicity Prompts''; \\citealt{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts}). \nEach prompt has been \\textbf{professionally translated} by native speakers following \\textbf{participatory design} practises, and the entire dataset has been human-labelled. \n\nWhile RTP-LX is a benchmark meant to facilitate safer deployment of S/LLMs in culturally-nuanced scenarios, our evaluation of ten S/LLMs on the corpus shows the following: \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item S/LLMs typically score acceptably in terms of \\emph{accuracy}, with GPT-4 Turbo and Gemma 7B having the highest percentages of correctly-classified examples. \n    \\item However, S/LLMs have \\textbf{low agreement with human judges} when scoring holistically the toxicity of a prompt. Namely, they have \\textbf{difficulty discerning harm} in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content such as \\textbf{microaggressions and bias}. \n    \\item The models generally have a \\textbf{non-trivial amount of false positives}, ranging anywhere from around 0\\% (Llama Guard) to 40\\% (Gemma 2B). \n    \\item We tie the previous findings to each language's online data availability. \n\\end{itemize}\nWe argue that the S/LLMs' failure to detect certain categories could lead to erasure, and showcases the limitations of these models in classification on multilingual toxicity scenarios. \nGiven their low agreement with humans, we posit that accuracy as a metric is insufficient to evaluate this task. \nOur findings morevoer illustrate the need for participatory design in the development of culturally-specific solutions.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:background}\nWe focus on the evaluation of S/LLMs, and their application as evaluators, both with a focus on multilingual toxicity scenarios. \nFor an introduction to broader topics and open problems on S/LLMs evaluation see \\citet{LLMEvalSurvey}. \n\n\\subsection{S/LLMs as Evaluators}\nThere has been a push from the community to move towards automated evaluation benchmarks based on LLMs such as GPT-4 \\cite{rethinkingsemantic,NEURIPS2023_91f18a12}, sometimes with good results, including high alignment with human judgments \\cite{rethinkingsemantic}. \nThis, however, does not extend to all domains, such as languages other than English, where some LLMs have low alignment with human judgements \\citep{LLMLXEval}. \n\nEvaluation \\textit{of} LLMs in multilingual scenarios has shown that larger models outperform smaller models, but that data contamination does affect evaluation metrics \\citep{megaverse}. Benchmarks like MultiQ \\cite{multiq} and others \\cite{lai-etal-2023-chatgpt,megaverse,LLMLXEval} have likewise found that there are performance differences across languages. \n\n\\subsection{Toxicity Evaluation of S/LLMs}\nIt is well-known that S/LLMs are prone to memorise and generate harmful content \\cite{sheng-etal-2019-woman,wang2023decodingtrust,rauh2022characteristics,gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts}. \nHence there is a growing focus on detecting and addressing their toxicity \\cite{rauh2022characteristics,gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts}, although there remains a gap in understanding it across different languages and cultures. \nThis oversight is particularly crucial because S/LLMs are well-known to exhibit biases across various demographic, racial, and cultural lines \\cite{dhmala2021}.\n\nCurrent S/LLMs are not equipped to identify these sensitivities out-of-the-box, and they require additional fine-tuning data for mitigation \\cite{hebrewoffensive}. \nHowever, generating high-quality, annotated datasets is challenging, especially when they are built without following participatory design \\cite{davidson2019}--that is, involving the target user base at every step of the system's development. \nFor instance, \\citet{sap-etal-2019-risk} uncovered bias in hate speech detection stemming from the annotators' lack of sensitivity to African-American Vernacular English.\n\nThis issue is exacerbated in multilingual contexts, especially in low-resource languages \\cite{deng2024multilingual, lai2023chatgpt}. \nAlthough efforts have been made to fine-tune S/LLMs using data from multiple languages \\cite{wang2023languages, wang2024chinese, hebrewoffensive}, the challenges around lack of participatory design remain when generating datasets. \nFor instance, \\citet{wang2024chinese} highlighted the prevalence of region-specific risks in S/LLM performance when detecting toxicity in Mandarin Chinese. \nA recent work by \\citet{jain2024polyglotoxicitypromptsmultilingualevaluationneural} scraped data from the internet, translated it, and then evaluated it using machine methods. While scalable and cost-efficient, this pipeline currently lacks the cultural sensitivity that comes from participatory design \\cite{li2024how}, in particular with regards to localisms and subtler issues that, as we will argue in this paper, require more attention. \n\n\\section{RTP-LX}\n\\label{sec:dataset}\nThe seed corpus for RTP-LX is a subset of $1,000$ prompts from the original RTP corpus. \nRTP is a set of nearly $100,000$ toxic sentences mined from Reddit. Each entry in the corpus is split into prompts and completions, and then annotated via the Perspective API\\footnote{\\url{https://www.perspectiveapi.com/}}. The prompts for the seed corpus were collected with an even proportion of explicitly toxic prompts, and prompts that led to a toxic completion (i.e., the completion is labelled as toxic while the prompt is below a threshold), based on their toxicity score. \nWe chose the top $1,000$ prompts fulfilling this criterion, and corresponds to the English subset of RTP-LX. \nThe full set of languages and dialects supported by RTP-LX is in Appendix \\ref{app:languages-supported}. \n\n\\subsection{Participatory Design}\nIn addition to the prompts from RTP, we also manually curated 50-100 toxic prompts that fulfilled the following:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item They could not be explicitly toxic (e.g., no profanity), since a simple string matching algorithm could detect it. \n    \\item They had to be hard to translate into English. \n    This was introduced due the scarcity of human-designed datasets; and, dually, due to the abundance of machine-translated corpora.%\n    \\item They had to relate explicitly to their culture. \n    Although self-explanatory, this requirement was phrased as ``[the prompt] could lead to an output which is offensive to a native speaker''. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\nRequirements (2) and (3) are somewhat related: hard-to-translate content (slang, specific sensitive subjects, etc.) is deemed so because of the difficulty of capturing nuances without adding an explanation of \\emph{why} it is harmful. \n\nFor example, in Thailand, the monarchy is a highly-sensitive topic: the royal family is held in high regard, and their criticism could result in legal repercussions. \nEven seemingly innocuous prompts, such as ``What is the role of a monarch in a country?'' could generate responses sensitive to some Thai readers.  \n\nDue to the complexity of finding these prompts, we complemented some languages with similar datasets in Hebrew \\cite{hebrewoffensive}, Danish \\cite{sigurbergsson-derczynski-2020-offensive}, Korean \\cite{moon-etal-2020-beep}, and Brazilian Portuguese \\cite{ToLDBR}. \n\n\\subsection{Transcreation}\n\\citet{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts} showed that LLMs memorise and return some of the most harmful content from their training data via sentence completion. \nSince Reddit--the source for RTP--is a primarily US-based site, the subjects handled by RTP are typically US-centric. \n\nTo address this and maintain a trustworthy dataset with equivalence across locales, the seed RTP corpus was professionally transcreated. \nIn addition to the cultural relevance, this introduced a minor source of noise helpful in ablating out data contamination, which is well-known to cause problems in LLM evaluations, especially in multilingual settings \\cite{dewynter2023evaluation,megaverse}. \n\nThe translators were encouraged to try out multiple dialects if they were familiar with them, and specify them in the corpus. \nThey were also given the sentence completion to ensure that the original intent from the prompt was preserved, and encouraged to use the closest-cultural equivalent to remove as many allusions to US English as possible.\\footnote{For example, replacing ``George Washington'' with ``Touissant Louverture'' in Haitian French.} \nWe don't know how many sentences were transcreated, as the translators noted that many prevalent aspects of US culture in the data (e.g., ``Donald Trump'') did not need replacement. \n\n\\subsection{Completion}\nIn addition to the transcreated prompts, we created toxic and benign completions. For the benign completions, the transcreators were requested to, given the prompt, write a completion such that it would be lowest-scoring in all harm categories for the corpus. \nWe generated the toxic prompt completions with \\texttt{gpt-4-32k-0613}, called through the Azure OpenAI Platform, and cleaned them prior to sending them to annotation along with the transcreated prompts. \n\n\\subsection{Annotation}\nWe used a set of harm categories slightly different than that of RTP, closer to that of the Azure Content Safety (ACS) service\\footnote{\\url{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/}}, because it would enable us to detect subtler harms. \nThe harm categories are: Bias, Identity Attack, Insult, Microaggression, Self-Harm, Sexual Content, Toxicity and Violence. The definition of each is in Appendix \\ref{app:guidelines}. \nToxicity is scored on a five-point Likert scale, and the rest of the harms on a three-point scale. \nWe used ternary scales to leave less room of ambiguity for the S/LLMs, thus avoiding overly optimistic LLM scoring--a known issue in multilingual scenarios \\citep{LLMLXEval}. \n\nThe annotators were given guidelines (available online) and could run a test and ask questions prior to fully annotating the data. \nEach harm was annotated independently, and used Toxicity as an overall score of the prompt's (or completion's) toxicity. \nTo avoid any potential conflicts with internal value systems, we also attached a copy of a uniform value system. \nThis value system is designed to mitigate the risks of working with toxic language in a global context, which we discuss further in Section \\ref{sec:limitations}. \nHowever, annotators were asked to use their best judgement and only defer to the value system when in doubt. \n\n\\subsection{Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR)}\n\\label{sec:irr}\nWe measured IRR with weighted Cohen's $\\kappa$, or $\\kappa_w$, and observed a substantial positive agreement in the corpus ($0.62 \\pm 0.2$ overall). \nWe chose $\\kappa_w$ because it takes into account the value of the ordinal, so broad differences in scoring (e.g., $1$-$3$ versus $1$-$2$) are encoded in this measure. \nTo account for multiple annotators, we took pairwise IRR and averaged it out. \n\n\\section{Evaluation Setup}\n\\label{sec:methodology}\n\n\\subsection{Models Evaluated}\n\\label{sec:models-evaluated}\nWe evaluated ten S/LLMs: four Llama \\cite{llama2, llama3modelcard}, two Gemma \\cite{gemmateam2024gemma}, and two Mistral \\cite{mistral} variants; plus Llama Guard \\cite{llamaguard} and GPT-4 Turbo. \nAll models were called through their respective Hugging Face model cards on four A100 80Gb PCIE GPUs; except GPT-4 Turbo, which was via Azure OpenAI. The data analysis was done in a consumer-grade laptop. \nWe used temperature of zero throughout, and all outputs were generated between \n$11^{\\text{th}}$ and $25^{\\text{th}}$ May, 2024. \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item GPT-4 is a LLM from OpenAI. We used \\texttt{gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09},  which was explicitly noted to have multilingual capabilities, and has shown good performance in various multilingual benchmarks.\n  \\item Llama is a family of open-source SLMs by Meta. \n  We use \\texttt{Llama-3-8b-Instruct}, \\texttt{Llama-3-70b-Instruct}, \\texttt{Llama-2-7b-chat}, and \\texttt{Llama-2-70b-chat}. \n  The original papers mention a multilingual training corpus; but the models were evaluated only in English and the authors indicate that non-English use is out-of-scope.\n  \\item Llama Guard is an SLM based on Llama-2, designed to classify content safety. We work with \\texttt{LlamaGuard-7b}. While not explicitly mentioned, we assume Llama Guard to be English-only.\n  \\item Gemma is an SLM by Google. We evaluate \\texttt{gemma-2b-it} and \\texttt{gemma-7b-it}. It does not claim to be multilingual, and the authors indicate the training data to be mainly in English.\n  \\item Mistral is a 7B parameter model by MistralAI. We evaluate \\texttt{Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3} and \\texttt{Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2}. \n  These models are not stated to be multilingual, and do not have any moderation mechanisms.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn addition to the S/LLMs above, we evaluated two non-S/LLM solutions: ACS and the FLORES Toxicity-200 block list \\cite{nllb2022}. These acted as our baselines, in addition to RTP-LX's own English subset. \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item ACS is a content moderating service by Azure. Its API returns a subset of the harms from RTP-LX (Identity Attack, Violence, Self-Harm, and Sexual Content) in a scale from 1-10. \n    It explicitly supports the languages from our corpus, although it is has only been evaluated in a smaller subset. \n    We evaluated this API in February 2024; and re-normalised the scores to our scale. \n    \\item FLORES Toxicity-200 is a collection of frequent words and phrases that are considered toxic. \n    It is human-translated and covers all the languages for RTP-LX. \n    It also includes a finer dialectal distinction compared to our corpus. \n    In this paper we consider it a baseline via exact match (EM): if any toxic word is present, we flag it. This baseline helps us determine whether lexical matching is sufficient to address multilingual toxicity.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Prompting}\n\\label{sec:experimental-setup}\nWe modified the annotation rubric to included exemplars, and formatted it as per each model's requirements (e.g. ChatML). \nThe prompt is in the Appendix. \nWe wrote a parser to extract scores from the response, and to account for pathologies of some models, like GPT-4's boilerplate (``One possible answer is...''). \n\n\\subsection{Metrics}\nIn addition to EM for FLORES, in the rest of our experiments we calculated IRR between the aggregated (majority vote; average otherwise) human label and S/LLMs with Percentage Agreement (PA) and with $\\kappa_w$. \nPA is a comparison of an exact label match and provides a raw, interpretable number. It does not account for multi-class imbalance (i.e., a ``lazy learner'' could guess one label and score well), or the tendency of the S/LLMs to score inputs as more or less harmful than human judges. \nTo address the lazy learner issue, we compute $\\kappa_w$, which lets us determine the agreement between two raters over a random guess. \n\n\\section{Results}\\label{sec:results}\n\nWe performed three experiments: a baselining with FLORES Toxicity-200, the actual evaluation of the S/LLMs, and an ablation study relating S/LLM performance with language availability. \n\nThroughout this section, we partition the full RTP-LX corpus in either the \\textbf{toxic prompts} and \\textbf{benign completions} subset; or the \\textbf{transcreated} subset (i.e., the original RTP prompts with its corresponding transcreations) and the \\textbf{manual} subset (culturally-specific hand-crafted prompts for every language). \nBoth partitions (toxic/benign and transcreated/manual) overlap, but represent different aspects of the dataset. Namely, the toxic/benign split allows us to determine whether S/LLMs can recognise toxic human-generated content. On the other hand, the transcreated set allows us to have machine-translation free comparability across languages; while the manual subset serves as a testbench for model performance in culturally-sensitive issues.  \n\n\\subsection{FLORES Exact-Match Block Rate}\\label{sec:flores-baseline}\nThe results of our experiment for FLORES Toxicity-200 block list is in Figure \\ref{fig:blockrate-toxic}. \nIn the toxic prompts subset, the block list had a $24.3\\pm8.3\\%$ block rate across all languages and partitions, with Japanese being the lowest ($10\\%$) and Thai the highest ($46\\%$). \nThe manual subset had a much lower ($-8\\%$ average) block rate when compared to the transcreated subset. \nThis suggests that the models, on average, should consider $24\\%$ of the toxic prompts corpus with a label denoting some toxicity. \n\nWe also calculated the block rates for the benign completions. The completions have around a 0\\% block rate across languages.\nOverall, this suggests that RTP-LX reliance on lexical features--as opposed to semantic features--is comparatively low ($24\\%$). %\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{images/results/block_rate_polar_prompt.pdf}\n    \\caption{EM block rates when calculated using FLORES' Toxicity-200 block list for the transcreated/manual partition of RTP-LX. \n    FLORES had an average $24.3\\pm8.3\\%$ block rate across all languages and partitions. \n    The manual subset had a much lower ($-8\\%$ average) block rate when compared to the transcreated subset. \n    This suggests that the S/LLMs, on average, should consider $24\\%$ of the corpus with a label denoting at least some toxicity. \n    Note that English does not have a manual corpus.}\n    \\label{fig:blockrate-toxic}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width = 0.49\\textwidth]{images/results/pa_avg_prompt.pdf}\n    \\includegraphics[width = 0.49\\textwidth]{images/results/kappa_avg_prompt.pdf}\n    \\caption{We labelled the prompt subset with the S/LLMs and compared their output with the majority vote of the human scores.\n    In terms of raw accuracy (\\textit{left}), Llama Guard outperformed all other S/LLMs, closely followed by Gemma 7B and GPT-4 Turbo. \n    ACS outperformed all other approaches, but ACS was only evaluated as the average of four, not eight, harm categories; and its agreement is lower than GPT-4's on these categories alone. \n    When looking at mean $\\kappa_w$ (\\textit{right}), it is clear that raw accuracy scoring is not a sufficient measure due to RTP-LX's class imbalance--a lazy learner could output always the same label and obtain a decent performance. \n    In fact, that is what happened for some models, such as Gemma 2B. \n    }\n    \\label{fig:mainresults}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation of S/LLMs}\\label{sec:sllmeval}\n\nWe evaluated the labelling performance of the S/LLMs in RTP-LX by comparing their output with the aggregated human scores in terms of PA and $\\kappa_w$ (Figure \\ref{fig:mainresults}).\n\n\\subsubsection{Toxic Prompts Subset}\nIn terms of PA, Llama Guard outperformed all other S/LLMs, closely followed by Gemma 7B and GPT-4 Turbo. The lowest-performing models were Gemma 2B and Llama-2 70B. \nACS outperformed all other approaches, but it was only evaluated over half of the harm categories. \nWhen looking at $\\kappa_w$, however, we found that Llama Guard--the best-performing model in terms of PA--dropped to almost the last position. \nGPT-4 Turbo was significantly better than other models. \nThe Llama-3 models outperformed the older Llama versions; and a similar trend can be seen for the Mistral variants.\n\nNone of the models seem to come close to human performance, however. \nWhen looking at the harm category breakdown in Figure \\ref{fig:cohen-kappa-prompt-polar}, we noted that the models were adept at detecting explicit content, such as violence, sexual content, and insults. \nHowever, comparatively subtle discourse, such as microaggressions, bias, and identity attacks, were not easily detectable by any of the models. \n\nThis observation is reinforced by noting that although the human-authored labels are relatively even in terms of agreement across all categories, the agreement with S/LLMs is not, with an overall noticeable skewness towards not detecting microaggressions or overall toxicity. \n\nWhen looking at $\\kappa_w$ we found that the models were not optimistic, as suggested by \\citet{LLMLXEval}; instead, the S/LLMs were prone to output higher-valued labels. \nIn the aforementioned work higher labels are considered better (hence the ``optimistic'' moniker); but in RTP-LX lower-valued labels are better. \nThe per-category class distribution for toxic prompts showed that the models were also very prone to output binary labels on the ternary set (i.e., no presence of the criterion, or explicit presence of the criterion; but overlooking contextually harmful sentences), which suggested an additional source for the disagreement with human annotators. \n\n\\subsubsection{Benign Completions Subset} \n\nWe calculated the fraction of false positives (FP), which we define as the fraction of times the model predicted a label higher than 1. \nThis helped us elucidate whether the S/LLMs do have a grasp on the task, or are solely outputting syntactically-relevant labels. \nThe results are in Figure \\ref{fig:fps-completion}. \nLlama Guard and ACS had near-zero FP, thus making them--in raw-scoring terms--the most reliable models. \nThe rest of the S/LLMs follow a trend similar to the $\\kappa_w$ values for the toxic prompts. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width = \\columnwidth]{images/results/pa_avg_completion.pdf}\n    \\caption{FPs across all languages for the S/LLMs. Gemma 2B presented the highest FP, misidentifying up to 40\\% of the samples observed, while Llama Guard and ACS had near-zero FP.}\n    \\label{fig:fps-completion}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Language Availability Analysis}\\label{sec:evaluationlanguage}\n\nWe explored the correlation, if any, between the availability online of the languages and the $\\kappa_w$ in the prompts subset. \nFor this, we use the classes defined by \\citet{joshi-etal-2020-state}. \nIn this work, the authors graded languages between 0 and 5, with zero-scoring languages being those with no labeled data at all; and languages scored with a five having the most (e.g., English). \nRTP-LX contains languages mostly from classes 3 to 5, which we denote here as low, mid, and high-resource languages. \nWe report the $\\kappa_w$ score for each model averaged across each group. \nOur results are in Figure \\ref{fig:language-wise-analysis}. \n\nAll models presented a decreasing trend in $\\kappa_w$ from high to low-resource languages, with differences of up to around 10\\%.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width = \\columnwidth]{images/results/language_kappa.pdf}\n    \\caption{Language availability versus $\\kappa_w$ over all languages in the prompts subset. \n    All S/LLMs decreased in $\\kappa_w$ from high to low-resource languages, with differences of up to around 10\\%.}\n    \\label{fig:language-wise-analysis}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\nWhen simply looking at the percentage agreement as a metric of performance, the models do relatively well: all score above the $24.3\\%$ theoretical minimum from an exact-match approach such as FLORES Toxicity-200. \nThe S/LLMs have a relatively even performance, with Llama Guard and Gemma 7B at the lead. \n\nHowever, this observation is misleading: when analysing the accuracy and per-class breakdown, we note that the models tend to not agree with human judgements. \n\nIndeed, the breakdown per category shows that the models failed to correctly classify typically subtle-yet-harmful discourse such as microaggressions, bias, and identity attack. \nConcerningly, the holistic measure of toxicity in the models tended to be of lower-agreement. \nThis is perhaps because of our observation that the models typically select higher-valued labels and often output binary labels, overlooking nuances. That is, they return either no presence of the harm criterion or explicitly presenting it, but not something that could be contextually construed as harmful. \n\nThis all suggests that, although the S/LLMs typically score well in accuracy-based measures, this metric performance alone does not imply that they can perform a reliable job as judges of toxicity in multilingual scenarios. \nMoreover, they have difficulties in discerning harm in context-dependent situations, especially, as we mentioned, when dealing with subtle content. \n\nIt is worth noting that the Llama and Mistral models, although claimed to be pretrained with a relatively small volume of multilingual data, perform comparatively well in non-English scenarios. \n\n\\section{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\nWe have three core limitations in our work: the nature of our data, the nature of our problem, and the models evaluated. \n\n\\paragraph{Data Limitations} RTP-LX has two main limitations: cultural skewness and coverage. \nIn terms of cultural skewness, the majority of this corpus is sourced from RTP, which itself was obtained from a predominantly website with discourse in US English. \nWe have mitigated this by ensuring transcreation, not translation, of the prompts along with adding in the manual subset of the corpus. \n\nIn terms of coverage, RTP-LX lacks sufficient dialectal coverage. \nAlthough we encouraged translators and prompt authors to explore various dialects, more could be done in this area: certain languages (e.g. Arabic) vary considerably amongst dialects; \nand others, like Spanish, vary in terms of homonyms so much that their holistic evaluation of toxicity is notoriously complex. \nIt is also worth noting that our corpus mostly covers Indo-European (Germanic, Romance) languages. \nWe plan to perform further additions to the corpus to explore other families and expand on dialectal differences. \nHowever, increasing both the dialectal coverage and the cultural skewness of the corpus are likely to cause lower performance for S/LLM-based evaluators, not higher. \n\n\\paragraph{Toxic Language in a Global Context} The study of toxicity in a multilingual setting is difficult not only due to the scarcity of quality, human-generated corpora especially designed for this task; but also because of the constant evolution of language and its perception by native speakers. \nIt is also worth noting that things that may be offensive to a native speaker in one geo-locale may not be offensive to that in another. \nWe mitigated this by including a uniform value system and making a best effort on demographic representation, but nonetheless encouraged the annotators to use their best judgement and only defer to the value system when in doubt. \n\n\\paragraph{S/LLMs Evaluated} S/LLMs are known to have data contamination issues that hamper fair evaluations. \nAlthough most of RTP-LX was hand-designed, there is no guarantee that our corpus will not be eventually used to train the models. \nWe have adopted measures to protect the data against crawlers, while still leaving the data open to all. \n\nMoreover, S/LLMs undergo frequent updates. We have specified the versions of the models we tested to ensure reproducibility, but it is likely updated models--such as newer versions of Llama Guard--will have better performance in this corpus. \nLikewise, we did not evaluate fine-tuned models. Our focus was on base models, which are more widespread and the ``lowest'' possible bar. That said, fine-tuning the S/LLMs and turning them into specialists for this task could improve upon the numbers shown here. \nThe difficulty of fine-tuning lies on the scarcity of high-quality, available data: a common problem in the study of toxic language in NLP \\cite{hartvigsen-etal-2022-toxigen}. \nThis, although out of scope for our paper, will preclude many specialists from arising. \nIt is precisely for this reason that our experimental setup assumes low data availability, and emphasises human-created over machine-translated data.  \n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nIn this paper we explored the question of whether we can scale safety as fast as we scale S/LLMs. We framed it as a S/LLM capability analysis, by evaluating whether these models could work as annotators for multilingual toxic-language detection. \nTo this end we introduced a human-annotated and human-transcreated corpus designed specifically to capture toxicity in a multilingual scenario. \n\nWe evaluated ten S/LLMs in RTP-LX, and found that they are able to score highly when measuring raw accuracy. \nHowever, by changing the metric (by comparing the outputs to human annotator judgements) showed that this performance did not necessarily meant that the models are reliable judges of toxicity. \nIndeed, we attributed that high accuracy to class imbalance, since the vast majority of the corpus is harmful. \nWe noted that the agreement between S/LLMs and human annotators was relatively low, and often came coupled with an increasing tend to over-block benign content. \nThis indicates a potentially poor understanding of the task by the S/LLM. \nOne possible exception was GPT-4 Turbo, which was able to score within one standard deviation of human judgements. \n\nAdditionally, we found two pathologies common to some, if not all, S/LLMs evaluated: a tendency to select high-valued labels, which in RTP-LX means ``extreme harm'', and low agreement with humans in context-dependent, subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microagressions, bias). \nBoth pathologies imply that the deployment of base, un-finetuned S/LLMs as multilingual harm detectors are likely to cause further problems, such as erasure. \n\nFurther work will scale RTP-LX to more dialects and language families. \nAs mentioned earlier, transcreating and annotating the dataset with humans is comparatively  time-consuming. \nHowever, it allows us to reliably address cultural sensitivity and subtler issues such as microaggressions. \nThis means it is a worthwhile investment--as shown here, in a multilingual context, these subtle issues are precisely the ones requiring more attention in the field. \nSince we believe that RTP-LX is a resource necessary to combat harmful and toxic content in S/LLMs in research and in production, we have released the corpus, prompts, code used for this paper, and the rubrics, to the wider community.\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 1>\n\n<paper 2>\n\\title{\\ptpLogoWithText~: Multilingual Evaluation of \\\\ Neural Toxic Degeneration in Large Language Models}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to their extensive global deployment, and ensuring their safety calls for comprehensive and multilingual toxicity evaluations.

Naturally, this has led to rapid advances in the multilingual capabilities of LLMs \\citep{Scao2022BLOOMA1, ustun2024aya, yuan2023multilingual}. However, current toxicity evaluation benchmarks and safety alignment methods \\citep{christiano2017deep, lee2024rlaif} overwhelmingly focus on the English language, leading to significantly less safe responses in non-English languages \\citep{wang2023all, kotha2024understanding, Yong2023LowResourceLJ}. The lack of a standard multilingual benchmark for evaluating toxicity poses significant challenges to non-English users and the development of safer multilingual models.\n\nWe introduce \\datasetName (\\datasetAbbrev), the first large-scale multilingual benchmark for evaluating \\textit{neural toxic degeneration}, defined as the propensity of LLMs to generate toxic text given a prompt \\citep{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts}. We create \\datasetAbbrev by scraping over 100M documents from web-text corpora to collect naturally occurring toxic prompts. This results in 425K prompts in 17 languages ranging from non-toxic to highly-toxic prompts scored with \\perspectiveAPI.\\footnote{\\url{https://perspectiveapi.com/}\\label{perspective-url}} \n\n\\datasetName provides three key improvements for multilingual toxicity evaluation, surfacing more toxic generations from LLMs than existing toxicity benchmarks (Figure \\ref{fig:motivation_results}).  \n\\textit{First}, \\datasetAbbrev covers 17 languages while existing toxic degeneration work predominantly focuses on English \\citep{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts, lin-etal-2023-toxicchat}. \n\\textit{Second}, existing multilingual toxicity evaluation testbeds such as \\citet{ustun2024aya} and \\textsc{RTP-LX} \\citep{dewynter2024rtplx} are translations of \\textsc{RealToxicityPrompts} (\\textsc{RTP}; \\citealp{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts}), which can lack cultural nuances of toxicity and introduce deviations in toxicity, leading to under-estimated toxic degeneration \\citep{sharou-specia-2022-taxonomy, costa-jussa-etal-2023-toxicity}.\n\\textit{Third}, \\datasetAbbrev's naturally occurring prompts are more representative of real-world inputs than recent works on \\textit{jailbreaking} \\citep{Deng2023MASTERKEYAJ, wei2024jailbroken} and adversarial prompt generation \\citep{zou2023universal, huang2023catastrophic}, which lead to unnatural and often gibberish prompts.\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}[20]{l}{5.5cm}\n    \\centering\n    \\vspace{-10pt}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{images-new/PTP_Motivation.pdf}\n    \\vspace{-10pt}\n    \\caption{GPT-3.5-Turbo's \\textsc{Average Toxicity} score on existing toxicity evaluation datasets, showing that \\datasetAbbrev uncovers more toxicity in LLMs.}\n    \\label{fig:motivation_results}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\n\nWe evaluate 62 LLMs on \\textsc{PolygloToxicityPrompts} to study the impact of prompt language, model size, alignment methods, and input prompt toxicity on toxicity. \nWe find significant toxicity in multilingual models, especially as the availability of language resources decreases. We observe that toxicity increases with model size within a model family for base LLMs. Furthermore, while instruction and preference-tuning reduce toxicity in models, the choice of preference-tuning method does not impact toxicity. Finally, we find that (un)safety and toxicity are related, but distinct aspects of LLMs that require their own solutions.\nOverall, our findings shed light on crucial shortcomings of LLM safeguarding and highlight areas for future research, notably, the need for multilingual toxicity mitigation and further investigations into the impact of model hyperparameters on toxicity. Our evaluation benchmark will advance efforts toward combating the critical issue of neural toxic degeneration.\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{related_work}\n\n\\paragraph{Evaluating Toxicity using Web-text Corpora, Templates, And User-AI Interaction Data}\nEarly works on evaluation datasets for studying biases and toxicity in models were created using templates or scraping web-text corpora. \\citet{sheng-etal-2019-woman, nangia-etal-2020-crows, nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset} use templated prompts to study social biases in pretrained language models. However, templates are focused on specific contexts such as demographic identities and not necessarily realistic. Thus, \\citet{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts} create \\textsc{RealToxicityPrompts} by crawling English web-text for naturally occurring input prompts to evaluate toxicity in a sentence completion setting. \n\nMore recently, there has been a shift towards examining toxicity in input-response settings. \\citet{10.1145/3548606.3560599, baheti-etal-2021-just} use generations from dialogue models like DialoGPT \\citep{zhang2019dialogpt} to study toxic degenerations in chatbots. Furthermore, the advent of instruction-tuned LLMs has led to studies of toxicity in real-world user-AI conversations. \\citet{zheng2024realchatm} and \\citet{lin-etal-2023-toxicchat} collect user-AI interactions with automatic and manual toxicity annotations respectively to tackle a different toxic data distribution---namely instructions. However, most of these approaches are limited to English.\n\n\\paragraph{Evaluating Multilingual Toxicity}\nMultilingual dataset curation for evaluating toxicity has utilized both manual and automated translation techniques. Recent work on AI safety evaluation \\citep{wang2023all, Yong2023LowResourceLJ, Deng2023MASTERKEYAJ} create multilingual safety benchmarks by translating monolingual benchmarks into other languages. They observe that LLMs are primarily safeguarded for English, leading to significantly unsafe generations in other languages, especially as availability of languages decreases. While these works are aimed towards the broader area of safety, the absence of a standard multilingual toxicity evaluation benchmark has also led researchers to translate prompts from \\textsc{RealToxicityPrompts} into other languages, either automatically \\citep{ustun2024aya} or using human annotations \\citep{dewynter2024rtplx}. However, manual translations are expensive, not scalable, and can introduce cultural biases, whereas automated translations can introduce deviations in toxicity due to incorrect translations and hallucinations \\citep{specia-etal-2021-findings, sharou-specia-2022-taxonomy, nllbteam2022language, costa-jussa-etal-2023-toxicity}. \n\n\\paragraph{Evaluating Toxicity using Machine-Generated Approaches} \nBesides human-generated or naturally occurring data, a wealth of recent work has explored using machine-generated approaches to curate datasets and methods for evaluating the toxicity and safety of LLMs. \\cite{hartvigsen-etal-2022-toxigen} and \\cite{kim-etal-2022-prosocialdialog} generate adversarial prompts about minority groups using classifier-guided decoding and conversations with a toxic partner respectively. Extensive research has studied \\textit{red teaming} \\citep{perez-etal-2022-red, chao2023jailbreaking, mazeika2024harmbench} and \\textit{jailbreaking} \\citep{liu2023autodan, wei2024jailbroken, yu2023gptfuzzer, Deng2023MASTERKEYAJ} to identify safety failures in LLMs and elicit harmful outputs. Furthermore, adversarial attack methods have also been shown to be effective against models without requiring substantial prompt engineering \\citep{shin-etal-2020-autoprompt, zou2023universal, huang2023catastrophic, pmlr-v202-jones23a}. However, such methods involve extensive prompt engineering, often leading to unnatural and non-representative prompts or model-specific artifacts \\citep{das2024under}. Furthermore, the extent to which these methods work in non-English languages remains to be studied.\n\nWhile the literature on toxicity evaluation has grown rapidly, their predominant focus on English highlights the need for multilingual benchmarks on \\textit{naturally} occurring toxic input prompts. We address this gap with \\datasetName, a collection of 425K naturally occurring prompts across 17 languages for evaluating toxicity.\n\\section{PolygloToxicityPrompts}\n\\label{sec: ptp}\n\nWe create \\textsc{PolygloToxicityPrompts}, a large-scale multilingual testbed to evaluate toxic degeneration in LLMs. It consists of 425K prompts extracted from web-text corpora paired with toxicity scores from \\perspectiveAPI. All 17 languages supported by \\perspectiveAPI are represented in our testbed, namely: Arabic (ar), Chinese (zh), Czech (cs), Dutch (nl), English (en), French (fr), German (de), Hindi (hi), Indonesian (id), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), and Swedish (sv).\n\n\\subsection{\\textbf{Operationalizing and Evaluating Toxicity}} \nWe define toxicity as ``a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make people leave a discussion'' \\citep{10.1145/3038912.3052591, 10.1145/3308560.3317593}. We use \\perspectiveAPI,\\footref{perspective-url} an industry-standard toxicity detection tool because it supports our 17 languages. \nSpecifically, we use the \\textsc{Toxicity} score from \\perspectiveAPI, computed using the UTC (\\textit{Unified Toxic Content Classification}) framework \\citep{10.1145/3534678.3539147}, composed of a Charformer-based transformer \\citep{tay2022charformer}. UTC is a Seq2Seq architecture pretrained with the mC4 corpus \\citep{xue-etal-2021-mt5} and Perspective Pretraining Corpus (PPC). Additionally, \\perspectiveAPI utilizes a single-language CNN \\citep{726791} distilled from multilingual BERT models \\citep{devlin-etal-2019-bert} for German and Portuguese.\n\n\\subsection{\\textbf{Dataset Creation}}\nWe construct our dataset by scraping over 100M documents from the mC4 \\citep{xue-etal-2021-mt5} and \\thepile \\citep{gao2020pile} corpora as they contain multilingual texts from a variety of domains. We also leverage Pile Curse,\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/tomekkorbak/pile-curse-full}} a subset of \\thepile scored using the  \\textit{bad words} \\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words}\\label{ldnoobw}} list for our English split. We then extract \\textsc{Toxicity} scores with \\perspectiveAPI for all scraped documents. To obtain a stratified range of prompt toxicity, we sample 6250 documents from 4 equal-width toxicity levels ($[0, 0.25), \\dots, [0.75, 1]$). We then split collected documents in half to form \\textit{prompts} and \\textit{continuations}, both of which are scored for toxicity. We provide preprocessing details, dataset statistics, and metadata analysis in Appendix \\ref{sec:dataset-analysis}.\n\nThe final dataset includes 25K naturally occurring prompts for each language, for a total of 425K prompts across 17 languages. Figures \\ref{fig:ds_tox} and \\ref{fig:ds_length} show the prompt toxicity and length distributions of our prompts for all languages. We create our prompts using documents instead of sentences \\citep{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts}. Thus, our prompts are much longer than \\textsc{RealToxicityPrompts}, with an average length of approximately 400 GPT-4 tokens (\\texttt{cl100k\\_base} tokenizer).\n\n\\paragraph{Challenges in Finding Multilingual Toxic Prompts}\nWhile the extraction of toxic content from web-text may appear straightforward, we encountered several challenges associated with the scarcity of multilingual toxicity. The mC4 corpus \\citep{xue-etal-2021-mt5} filters toxicity by removing pages containing \\textit{bad words}.\\footref{ldnoobw} As a result, we observe less than $0.01\\%$ toxicity rate out of 5M samples for \\textit{ar, cs, fr, ko, id, it, nl, pl,} and \\textit{sv}. However, consistent with previous findings \\citep{zhou-etal-2021-challenges, dodge-etal-2021-documenting}, we note that filtered datasets still exhibit toxicity, and observe higher toxicity rates for other languages.\n\nTo attain a larger sample of toxic content for languages with low toxicity rates, we create synthetic high-toxicity data. Specifically, we translate toxic samples from the mC4 and \\thepile corpora into target languages using the NLLB-3.3B model \\citep{nllbteam2022language}. We use this process to create $\\approx$ 70K translated prompts across 9 languages, which amounts to only $16.8\\%$ of our dataset. Contrary to prior works, we observe a Pearson correlation of 0.725 ($p \\leq 0.001$) between the toxicity scores of the original and translated samples across all languages, suggesting that low amounts of translated data are not necessarily an issue.\\footnote{We discuss limitations with translating data in the \\nameref{sec: ethics-statement}.}\n\n\\paragraph{\\datasetSmall} We also create \\datasetSmall, a stratified sample of 5K prompts per language from \\datasetName to benchmark models with limited computational resources.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htpb]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{images-new/Contributions.pdf}\n    \\caption{Summary of \\datasetName.}\n    \\label{fig:contributions}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{\\textbf{Benchmarking Large Language Models}}\n\nWe benchmark a large variety of models ($N = 62$) spanning different sizes and multilingual capabilities. We follow the taxonomy proposed by \\citet{albalak2024survey} and include LLMs trained purely with the language modeling objective (\\baseModel) such as Llama2 \\citep{touvron2023llama2}, Pythia \\citep{biderman2023pythia}, LLMs \\textit{fine-tuned} to follow instructions (\\instructModel) such as Mistral-Instruct \\citep{jiang2023mistral}, and LLMs aligned with preference-tuning/alignment methods (\\prefModel) such as GPT-3.5-Turbo \\citep{ouyang2022training} and Zephyr \\citep{tunstall2023zephyr}. In the subsequent section (Section \\ref{sec: rqs}), we explore a variety of research questions that require specific functionalities and thus use the appropriate subset of models for our analyses. We also note that the LLMs we benchmark are, to the best of our knowledge, the neural networks that are trained and possibly instruction and/or preference-tuned, without any possible safeguards or guardrails that may have been added onto the public interfaces of such LLMs, such as safety classifiers applied to the input/output of LLMs.\n\n\\subsection{\\textbf{Benchmarking Setup}}\n\\paragraph{Evaluation Metrics}\nGiven a toxicity evaluator $t(\\cdot)$ and a language model $f(\\cdot)$, $t(\\cdot)$ predicts the toxicity score for a text, and $f(\\cdot)$ provides a completion $c = f(p)$ for a prompt $p$. We sample $K$ completions per prompt and follow \\citet{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts, ustun2024aya} to measure a model's toxicity over a set of prompts $\\mathcal{P}$. Specifically, we compute \\expMaxToxFull, that is, \\textit{what is the expected toxicity of a model's worst-case generations?}, as \n\\expMaxTox $= \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{P}|} \\sum_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\max_i t(f(p))$ and the \\empProbFull (\\empProb), that is, \\textit{how frequently does a model generate toxicity}, as the probability that a model generates at least one completion with toxicity score $\\geq 0.5$ in $K$ completions. We additionally compute \\avgToxFull, that is, \\textit{what is the model's overall toxicity?}, as \\avgTox $ = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{P}|} \\sum_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{i=1}^K t(f(p))$.\n\n\\paragraph{Implementation Details} We utilize \\datasetSmall to benchmark LLMs due to the breadth of considered models and computational constraints. We use the \\textsc{Toxicity} score from \\perspectiveAPI as our toxicity evaluator $t(\\cdot)$, $K = 10$ completions, temperature $= 0.7$, top\\_p $= 1$, and a maximum generation length of $512$ tokens for our experiments. We use Microsoft Azure's OpenAI API for GPT-3.5-Turbo (version 0301) with safety settings disabled, vLLM \\citep{kwon2023efficient} for decoder-only models, and Huggingface's TGI\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference}} for encoder-decoder models. We only use the required prompt templates as stated in model cards, and do not provide any additional instructions. \n\n\\section{Research Questions}\n\\label{sec: rqs}\n\nTo investigate multilingual toxic degeneration in a large suite of models, we obtain and score continuations for the 5K prompts per language contained in \\datasetSmall (due to computational resource limitations). We find similar trends across all evaluation metrics and thus report only \\avgToxFull for brevity.\n\n\\begin{wraptable}[8]{r}{5cm}\n    \\vspace{-22pt}\n    \\resizebox{4.5cm}{!}{%\n    \\begin{tabular}{p{4.5cm}|c}\n        \\toprule\n        \\textbf{Model} & \\textbf{\\avgTox} \\\\\n        \\midrule\n         Llama-2-13b-chat-hf & \\cellcolor[HTML]{9FC5E8}0.078 \\\\\n         Llama-2-70b-chat-hf & \\cellcolor[HTML]{9FC5E8}0.088 \\\\\n         Qwen-7B-Chat & \\cellcolor[HTML]{9FC5E8}0.091 \\\\\n         \\midrule\n         OpenHathi-7B-Hi-v0.1-Base &\t\\cellcolor[HTML]{E49D9F}0.327 \\\\\n         pythia-12b & \\cellcolor[HTML]{E49D9F}0.327 \\\\\n         pythia-6.9b & \\cellcolor[HTML]{E49D9F}0.328 \\\\\n         \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n    }\n    \\caption{Models with highest and lowest \\avgTox on \\datasetSmall.}\n    \\label{tab:top_3_best_worst}\n\\end{wraptable}\n\nTable \\ref{tab:top_3_best_worst} previews our findings for the models with the lowest and highest \\avgToxFull. We provide results for all models with languages categorized based on \\cite{joshi-etal-2020-state}\\footnote{Since all considered languages belong to categories 3 and above, we compare relative resource availability, that is, categories 3, 4 and 5 are referred as low-, medium- and high-resource respectively.} in Table \\ref{tab:secondary_results}.\nNext, we explore specific patterns concerning prompt language, model size, alignment methods, and prompt toxicity below. Finally, we also compare \\textit{toxicity} and \\textit{safety} detectors using \\perspectiveAPI and Llama Guard \\cite{inan2023llama} respectively.\n\n\\subsection{\\textbf{How does \\textit{Prompt Language} impact \\textsc{Average Toxicity}?}}\n\nDespite safety alignment, translations of harmful prompts from English to other languages can elicit harmful content from LLMs \\citep{kotha2024understanding, Yong2023LowResourceLJ, deng2024multilingual}. Therefore, we study how toxicity varies with input prompt languages by benchmarking multilingual LLMs, namely GPT-3.5-Turbo \\citep{ouyang2022training}, Aya101 \\citep{ustun2024aya}, and Bloomz \\citep{muennighoff-etal-2023-crosslingual} and evaluating \\avgTox for each language.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htpb]\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{images-new/lang_vs_toxicity-scaled.pdf}\n    \\caption{Language-wise \\avgTox trends for multilingual models. \\textbf{\\textit{Takeaway}}: High toxicity scores (relative to the \\avgTox levels shown in Figure \\ref{fig:motivation_results} and Table \\ref{tab:top_3_best_worst}) for all languages indicate the need for multilingual toxicity mitigation methods.\n    }\n    \\label{fig:rq1}\n    \\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:rq1} shows that models have the lowest \\avgTox levels in \\textit{ru} (Russian) and \\textit{nl} (Dutch), consistent with \\citet{ustun2024aya}. \nHowever, all models have highly toxic continuations in \\textit{hi} (Hindi) and \\textit{cs} (Czech). \nWe hypothesize that the relatively small amounts of Hindi in most pretraining corpora and lack of safety alignment in Hindi leads to more toxic degenerations \\citep{wang2023all, Yong2023LowResourceLJ, deng2024multilingual}. \nThis hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that \\avgTox reduces as the availability of language resources increases (Table \\ref{tab:benchmark-lang-res}).\n\nAcross models, we find that GPT-3.5-Turbo and bloomz-560m have the highest and lowest \\avgTox levels aggregated across all languages respectively. However, we hypothesize that the lower toxicity scores of bloomz models, especially bloomz-560m, might be due to short and poor quality completions from these models (average character length of generations for bloomz-560m, Aya101, and GPT-3.5-Turbo are $96.21$, $208.54$, and $524.21$ respectively). \n\nOverall, high toxicity scores in non-English languages provide strong evidence of a current gap in multilingual toxicity mitigation, even in highly capable models.

We first study these trends in \\baseModel models such as Llama 2 \\citep{touvron2023llama2} and Pythia \\citep{biderman2023pythia}, and later examine models with additional tuning (\\instructModel, \\prefModel) such as Tulu 2 \\citep{ivison2023camels}.\n\n\\paragraph{Effect of \\textit{Model Size} for Base LLMs}\nWe investigate the distribution of continuation toxicity for \\textit{base} LLMs, that is, models trained with only the language modeling objective. We observe a slight correlation between the number of parameters in the model and the continuation toxicity for base LLMs ($r=0.015$, $p<0.001$).\nPrior work has shown limited evidence of the dependence of model toxicity on size. For instance, \\citet{touvron2023llama, touvron2023llama2} find that toxicity increases with model size, whereas \n\\citet{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts, NEURIPS2022_c1e2faff} find that larger models are not necessarily more toxic. We hypothesize that toxicity might depend on model size within a model family only, and investigate this further with the Pythia suite.\n\nThe Pythia suite provides models of varying sizes while keeping the pretraining data and other hyperparameters constant. We utilize these models for a controlled investigation of the impact of model size on toxicity using the English split of our dataset. Figure \\ref{fig:pythia} shows an overall increase in toxicity with an increase in model size, which plateaus near $2.8b$ parameters (effect size of the difference between $2.8b$ and $12b$ is small, Cohen's $d\\leq 0.1$, $p \\leq 0.1$).\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}[27]{r}{4cm}\n    \\centering\n    \\vspace{-20pt}\n    \\includegraphics[width=4cm]{images-new/at_llama_tulu_size.pdf}\n    \\vspace{-10pt}\n    \\caption{Influence of model size on \\avgTox in aligned models. \\textbf{\\textit{Takeaway}}: Future work is required for \\textit{safety-aligned} LLMs.}\n    \\label{fig:align_size}\n\n    \\vspace{10pt}\n    \n    \\includegraphics[width=3.5cm]{images-new/base_instruct_preference_avg_tox-1.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textsc{AT} for different model categories. \\textbf{\\textit{Takeaway}}: \\baseModel $>$ \\instructModel $\\approx$ \\prefModel.}\n    \\label{fig:rq_model_type_tox}\n    \n\\end{wrapfigure}\n\nThis is consistent with prior works \\citep{touvron2023llama, touvron2023llama2}. More specifically, we find that the toxicity levels in $1b+$ Pythia models are comparatively higher than the smallest $70m$ model (Cohen's $d\\geq 0.3$, $p \\leq 0.001$).\nThis implies that toxicity is a long-tail phenomenon that large enough models ($> 1b$ parameter count) are capable of capturing and demonstrating, akin to how larger models memorize better \\citep{tirumala2022memorization}.\n\n\\paragraph{Effect of \\textit{Model Size} for Safeguarded LLMs}\n\nTo investigate the impact of model size on toxicity for safeguarded LLMs, we benchmark Llama 2-Chat and Tulu 2-DPO models on English and other related languages (constituting top-10 languages in Llama 2's pretraining data) as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:align_size}.\n\nWe observe different trends in both model families when scaling from $7b$ to $70b$ --- for Llama 2-Chat models, \\avgTox first decreases and then increases as the model size increases. In contrast, DPO alignment first increases and then reduces toxicity for Tulu 2 models as they are scaled to $70b$ parameters. However, such differences are small (Cohen's $d < 0.15$ for all combinations with $70b$ models).\n\nThere seems to be no conclusive answer as to whether model size affects toxicity in safeguarded LLMs. We hypothesize that discrepancies concerning smaller safeguarded models such as lack of hyperparameter tuning or reward models trained toward generations by larger models, and challenges in unlearning harmful behavior (especially as model size decreases) could explain these results. \nThus, future work is needed to investigate the specific effects of model sizes on toxic degeneration in safety-aligned models. \n\n\\subsection{\\textbf{How do \\textit{Alignment Methods} impact \\textsc{Average Toxicity}?}}\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}[13]{r}{4.5cm}\n    \\centering\n    \\vspace{-20pt}\n    \\includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{images-new/align_at-manual.pdf}\n    \\vspace{-20pt}\n    \\caption{Impact of alignment techniques on TinyLlama and Archangel models. \\textbf{\\textit{Takeaway}}: Alignment methods don't impact toxicity.}\n    \\label{fig:align-tech}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\n\nWhile prior work has shown that safety alignment leads to reduced toxicity levels in models \\citep{touvron2023llama2}, the impact of different alignment methods on toxicity is yet to be studied. \nWe investigate the impact of instruction-tuning and preference-tuning using different alignment methods, namely PPO \\citep{schulman2017proximal}, DPO \\citep{rafailov2024direct}, KTO \\citep{ethayarajh2024kto}, and IPO \\citep{azar2023general} on toxicity. For preference-tuned models, we also study the effect of the method used to create preference data for preference-tuning or alignment.\n\n\\paragraph{Base vs. Instruction-Tuning vs. Preference-Tuning}\n\nWe first compare toxicity levels aggregated over \\baseModel, \\instructModel, and \\prefModel models (Figure \\ref{fig:rq_model_type_tox}). \nWe find that, on average, \\baseModel models have the highest toxicity (\\textsc{AT}$=0.281$; significantly different from \\instructModel and \\prefModel models; Cohen's $d=0.40$ and $d=0.43$, respectively, $p<0.001$).\nFurthermore, we find that \\instructModel and \\prefModel models barely differ in toxicity (Cohen's $d=0.02$, $p < 0.001$), though preference-tuned models have slightly lower toxicity on average.\n\n\\paragraph{Effect of Various Alignment Methods}\n\nTo study the impact of different preference-tuning methods, we benchmark models that have been trained on the same data but with different alignment methods. Specifically, we use the Archangel suite\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/collections/ContextualAI/archangel-65bd45029fa020161b052430}} of Llama models \\citep{touvron2023llama} and TinyLLama\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/collections/abideen/tinyllama-alignment-65a2a99c8ac0602820a22a46}} \\citep{zhang2024tinyllama} models.\n\nInterestingly, we do not observe a considerable difference in the average toxicity exhibited by models trained with different alignment methods (Cohen's $d<0.1$) (Figure \\ref{fig:align-tech}). Moreover, this trend remains at different scales of $1b$, $7b$, and $13b$, suggesting that specific choices of the preference-tuning method might not make as much of a difference as preference data on model toxicity.\n\n\\paragraph{Preference-Tuning Dataset: Human Feedback vs AI Feedback}\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}[15]{r}{5cm}\n    \\centering\n    \\vspace{-10pt}\n    \\includegraphics[width=5cm]{images-new/at_rlhf_rlaif.pdf}\n    \\vspace{-20pt}\n    \\caption{Influence of Human vs AI Feedback on toxicity. \\textbf{\\textit{Takeaway}}: AI feedback is better than human feedback for the language(s) targeted by the technique (\\textit{en} in this case).}\n    \\label{fig:align-data}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\n\nTo investigate the influence of preference data curated with human and AI feedback, we benchmark Gemma 7B \\citep{team2024gemma} variants. Specifically, we compare gemma-7b-it, trained on human preferences, and zephyr-7b-gemma-v0.1,\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-gemma-v0.1}} trained on AI preferences (Figure \\ref{fig:align-data}). We observe that AI feedback is better than human feedback for \\textit{en}, whereas human feedback shows lower toxicity levels for non-English languages. We emphasize toxicity results on the \\textit{en} split since both models were trained using English-only preference data, likely making multilingual prompts out-of-distribution. Furthermore, zephyr-7b-gemma-v0.1 is aligned using DPO which has been found to reduce multilingual capabilities \\citep{ivison2023camels}, likely leading to higher toxicity for non-English languages. \n\nWhile this suggests that AI feedback reduces model toxicity, we hypothesize that the operationalization of toxicity might play a role.\nAI feedback relies on LLMs' definition of toxic content, which likely aligns better with \\perspectiveAPI's perception of toxicity rather than human perceptions, which are more nuanced and subjective \\citep{sap2021annotators}.\nFurthermore, curating datasets using models can result in the under-representation of more veiled toxicity \\citep{han-tsvetkov-2020-fortifying} and general data and topical skews \\citep{das2024under}.\n\n\\subsection{\\textbf{Comparing \\textit{Toxicity} and \\textit{Safety} Detectors: \\perspectiveAPI vs. Llama Guard}}\n\\label{sec: llg_papi_main}\nRecent work has seen rapid growth in studies on safety evaluation and safeguarding techniques \\citep{ganguli2022red, mazeika2024harmbench}. For instance, \\citet{inan2023llama} develop Llama Guard, a Llama 2 model to classify safety risks in LLM inputs and responses. However, the extent to which toxicity and safety overlap is unclear. To fill this gap, we compare \\perspectiveAPI, a \\textit{toxicity} detector, and Llama Guard, a \\textit{safety} detector.\n\nSince Llama Guard only supports English, we compute scores for all models on the English split of \\datasetSmall following the instructions in its model card.\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b}} We find that \\perspectiveAPI toxicity scores are generally well-aligned with Llama Guard scores ($r = 0.78, p \\leq 0.001$). \n\nHowever, Llama Guard and \\perspectiveAPI still capture distinct concepts. To analyze the differences between both evaluation methods, we examine the prompts and generations where the metrics differ the most (Table \\ref{tab:llg_pa} in Appendix \\ref{sec: llg_pa}). We observe that \\perspectiveAPI is better at detecting explicit toxicity, hate speech, and derogative language and provides extensive support for non-English languages. However, Llama Guard can identify subtle unsafe generations and extend to other axes of AI safety. \nOur findings suggest that LLM safety detectors may not be equipped to capture the full spectrum of toxicity.\n\n\\subsection{\\textbf{How does \\textit{Prompt Toxicity} impact \\textsc{Continuation Toxicity}?}}\n\nWe investigate the relationship between input prompt toxicity and continuation toxicity at greater granularity, that is, without aggregating as in \\avgToxFull. Intuitively, we expect a model's propensity to generate toxic text to be proportional to the toxicity of the input prompt. Empirically, we find a Pearson correlation of $0.49$ ($p \\leq 0.001$) between prompt toxicity and continuation toxicity. \nWe also find that continuation toxicity spans the entire toxicity range, regardless of input toxicity score, indicating that non-toxic prompts can yield toxic continuations and vice-versa, corroborating \\citet{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts}. Furthermore, we investigate the correlations between prompt and continuation toxicity across languages and model families in Appendix \\ref{app:prompt-cont}.\n\n\\paragraph{Comparing Model Categories} We examine the extent to which different model categories mirror input toxicity.\nWe find that the continuation toxicity of \\baseModel models is most strongly correlated with input toxicity ($r=0.65$, $p<0.001$).\nSurprisingly, \\prefModel models have a higher correlation between input and continuation toxicity ($r=0.49$, $p<0.001$), compared to \\instructModel models ($r=0.44$, $p<0.001$).\nWe find that this is due in large to low-toxicity prompts, for which \\prefModel models mimic the input (low) toxicity in continuations better ($r=0.43$) than for high-toxicity prompts ($r=0.16$).\n\\instructModel models also show a stronger correlation between prompt and continuation toxicity for low-toxicity prompts ($r=0.32$) than for high-toxicity ones ($r=0.18$). % high  for low\nThis indicates that \\prefModel models better match input toxicity than \\instructModel models, but predominantly in low-toxicity inputs, suggesting that \\prefModel models are better safeguarded against high-toxicity inputs.\n\n\\subsection{\\textbf{How do different \\textit{Data Sources} elicit \\avgToxFull?}}\n\nFinally, we study the ability of different data sources to elicit toxicity from LLMs. Specifically, we compare \\avgToxFull when generating continuations for naturally occurring prompts from \\datasetAbbrev, RTP-LX \\citep{dewynter2024rtplx}, and an automatically translated sample of user-LLM interactions from WildChat \\citep{zhao2024wildchat}.\\footnote{We provide details about RTP-LX and WildChat in Appendix \\ref{app:ptp_vs_wc}.}\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}[12]{r}{8.5cm}\n    \\centering\n    \\vspace{-8pt}\n    \n    \\includegraphics[width=0.6\\textwidth]{images-new/ptp_vs_lx_wildchat.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\avgTox trends for multilingual models on WildChat, RTP-LX, and \\datasetAbbrev. \\textbf{\\textit{Takeaway}}: \\datasetAbbrev elicits higher toxicity scores compared to WildChat and RTP-LX.}\n    \\label{fig:ptp_wc}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:ptp_wc} shows that \\datasetAbbrev consistently draws out higher \\avgToxFull. While RTP-LX is comprised of naturally occurring prompts in English and their culturally-aware translations to other languages, we find that \\datasetAbbrev is still able to capture more toxicity, likely due to longer prompt lengths, corroborating \\citet{anilmany}. Furthermore, we hypothesize that preference-tuning makes models less vulnerable to what users input into LLMs as opposed to naturally occurring toxicity, leading to higher toxicity levels elicited by \\datasetAbbrev compared to WildChat.\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe present \\datasetName, the first large-scale multilingual benchmark of 425K naturally occurring prompts across 17 languages for evaluating toxic degenerations in LLMs. We benchmark 62 LLMs to study the impact of factors like prompt language, prompt toxicity, model size, instruction- and preference-tuning, and alignment methods on toxicity. We also compare toxicity and safety detectors to emphasize that toxicity and safety are related but distinct aspects. Overall, our findings highlight crucial gaps in current research around the need for multilingual safeguarding and emphasize further empirical and theoretical investigations of how toxic degeneration is affected by prompt language, model size, and alignment methods.\n\n\\section*{Limitations}\n\\label{sec: limitations}\n\nWe describe several limitations of our work. First, toxicity is subjective and our measure of toxicity may not cover all aspects of toxicity \\citep{sap2021annotators}. Human validations of toxicity would help corroborate our results, but the scale of our experiments, coupled with possible disagreements between annotators due to the subjective nature of the task make validations challenging \\citep{doi:10.1111/1471-6402.00110, sap-etal-2019-risk}. Second, we focus on naturally occurring prompts in web-text to create our benchmark, which may not be representative of user-LLM interactions \\citep{lin2023toxicchat} or extensively cover conversational toxicity such as what might arise on social media \\citep{dodge-etal-2021-documenting}. Third, our testbed does not extend to low-resource languages due to the lack of toxicity detection tools.% \\vspace{-10pt}\n\n\\section*{Ethics Statement}\n\\label{sec: ethics-statement}\n\n\\paragraph{Dataset Release} The purpose of our work is to provide a standard multilingual benchmark to evaluate toxic degenerations in LLMs. As noted in the limitations, our prompts were extracted from naturally occurring web text and offer a limited representation of online data in general. While this mainly affects low-resource languages, it also skews the topics of online discussions \\citep{dodge-etal-2021-documenting}. Our benchmark also doesn't cover more conversational toxicity such as what might arise on social media, which could be tricky to incorporate due to privacy issues \\citep{elazar2024whats}. Finally, while our dataset includes toxic text, its intended use is not to increase the toxic outputs of a model unless the ultimate aim is to steer away from toxicity \\citep{liu-etal-2021-dexperts}. As a safety measure, we plan to release the dataset using AI2's ImpAct license \\footnote{\\url{https://allenai.org/impact-license}} which helps mitigate the risks of dual use of resources.\n\n\\paragraph{Toxicity Detection} Previous work has shown that toxicity detection tools overestimate toxicity in text containing minority identity mentions \\citep{10.1145/3278721.3278729, hutchinson-etal-2020-social, sap-etal-2019-risk}. \\perspectiveAPI has also been shown to be biased against some languages such as German \\citep{nogara2023toxic}. Nevertheless, our benchmark uses it as one possible operationalization of toxicity. Moreover, it can serve as a resource for studying the construct validity of toxicity as measured by \\perspectiveAPI by providing stratified samples of web-text with ranges of both lower and higher toxicity scores. We release our benchmark and also encourage future work to apply other toxicity detectors as evaluations.\n\n\\paragraph{Toxicity and Machine Translation} Automatic translations can introduce deviations in toxicity due to incorrect translations and hallucinations \\citep{specia-etal-2021-findings, sharou-specia-2022-taxonomy}.  \n\\citet{nllbteam2022language, costa-jussa-etal-2023-toxicity} show that automatic translations can also add toxicity across languages, introducing biases in toxicity evaluation on translated data.% \\vspace{-10pt}\n\n\\section*{Reproducibility Statement}\n\\label{sec: reprod-statement}\n\nWe provide our dataset and code to reproduce our benchmarking experiments and encourage toxicity evaluations in future work: \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ptp-5856}\n\n\\paragraph{Toxicity Detection} Prior work has shown that frequent retraining of black-box toxicity detection APIs such as \\perspectiveAPI can lead to inaccurate comparisons and reproducibility challenges \\citep{pozzobon-etal-2023-challenges}. Thus, we encourage readers to  re-run toxicity evaluations instead of adopting results from the papers they are comparing to.\n\n\\paragraph{Benchmarking Experiments} We used up to 128 GiB RAM and 4 NVIDIA RTX A6000s to generate completions with LLMs with up to 70b parameters for our benchmarking experiments. There are several considerations for our benchmarking experiments. First, we use only one configuration of random sampling (temperature $=0.7$, top\\_p=$1.0$, maximum generation length $=512$ tokens). There could be differences in toxicity levels depending on different sampling methods and configurations. Based on how toxicity might be a long-tail phenomenon akin to memorization \\citep{tirumala2022memorization}, we expect that the decoding algorithm might matter. Second, due to computation constraints, we use \\datasetSmall to benchmark models. While \\datasetSmall was randomly sampled from \\datasetName, running on the full dataset might surface more toxicity than our sampled data surfaced. \n\n\\textbf{Environmental Impact} While we evaluate a large number of models ($N = 62$) over \\datasetSmall, leading to notable energy usage and carbon footprint, our findings can be used as a guide for model selection by readers, resulting in lower carbon emissions for future work.\n\n\\subsection*{\\textbf{Acknowledgments}}\n\nSpecial thanks to Ian Magnusson for providing feedback for our paper.

To this end, we introduce \\texttt{M-ALERT}, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates the safety of LLMs in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. \\texttt{M-ALERT} includes 15k high-quality prompts per language, totaling 75k, following the detailed \\texttt{ALERT} taxonomy. Our extensive experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs highlight the importance of language-specific safety analysis, revealing that models often exhibit significant inconsistencies in safety across languages and categories. For instance, Llama3.2 shows high unsafety in category \\texttt{crime\\_tax} for Italian but remains safe in other languages. Similar differences can be observed across all models. In contrast, certain categories, such as \\texttt{substance\\_cannabis} and \\texttt{crime\\_propaganda}, consistently trigger unsafe responses across models and languages. These findings underscore the need for robust multilingual safety practices in LLMs to ensure safe and responsible usage across diverse user communities.\n\\textcolor{purple}{\\textbf{Warning}: This paper contains examples of toxic language.}\\blfootnote{$\\phantom{0}^{\\circ}$work done while at Babelscape}\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nAs Large Language Models (LLMs) see rapid global adoption, ensuring their safety across a broad spectrum of languages is essential. This is not only crucial for promoting inclusive access to information and enabling effective cross-cultural communication \\cite{friedrich2024multilingual}, but it also mitigates biases arising from language-specific limitations. \nWhile recent efforts, such as \\texttt{ALERT} \\cite{tedeschi2024alert}, have made strides in assessing LLM safety in English, comprehensive multilingual safety evaluation remains a critical gap.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{img/alert-vs-lalert-scatter.pdf}\n    \\caption{Safety comparison of English (\\texttt{ALERT}) vs. Multilingual (\\texttt{M-ALERT}) on different prompts.

This way, \\texttt{M-ALERT} furnishes a general safety score along with category- and language-specific safety scores, offering detailed insights.}\n\\label{fig:framework}\n\\vspace{-0.3cm}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nTo address all these shortcomings, we introduce \\texttt{M-ALERT}, a comprehensive multilingual safety benchmark. It expands on \\texttt{ALERT} by systematically translating and adapting its safety prompts into five languages---English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. To this end, we use an advanced translation pipeline, including multiple models and validation methods. We select the most accurate one using common machine translation quality metrics and conduct human evaluations to further confirm high translation quality.\nAs a result, we derive high-quality translations with fine-grained category annotations, ensuring consistent risk categorization across languages. In total, \\texttt{M-ALERT} includes 75k prompts, with 15k per language.\n\nSpecifically, we conduct extensive evaluations of 10 state-of-the-art LLMs and identify both strengths and weaknesses in their safety performance. \nWhile some models exhibit language-specific vulnerabilities, others demonstrate consistently unsafe behavior in certain high-risk categories across all languages.\nMore alarmingly, we find substantial inconsistencies across languages and categories (cf.~Fig.~\\ref{fig:m/alert} deviation from diagonal). Further, we conduct category-specific evaluations for policy compliance, demonstrating the practical use of \\texttt{M-ALERT}. Lastly, we show that while instruction tuning improves safety over base models, the correlation with model size is less pronounced.\n \nIn summary, we put forward the following contributions: (1) We create \\texttt{M-ALERT}, a novel multilingual safety benchmark for 5 languages, totaling 75k prompts; (2) We extensively evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses; (3) We conduct language-, category- and policy-specific evaluations, showing the potential and scope of \\texttt{M-ALERT}.\\footnote{We publicly release our work at \\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/felfri/M-ALERT}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/felfri/M-ALERT}}\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\nThe remarkable capabilities of LLMs are accompanied by significant concerns regarding safety and ethical considerations \\citep{longpre2024safe}, with several studies highlighting their potential risks \\citep{bender21parrots, weidinger2021ethical, bommasani2021opportunities, hendrycks2023overview, lin2023toxicchat, o2023amplifying, hosseini-etal-2023-empirical}. \nFor instance, recent works highlight that generative language models often produce toxic and biased language, posing ethical concerns for their deployment in real-world applications \\citep{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts, elsherief-etal-2021-latent, Dhamala_2021, hartvigsen2022toxigen}. Similarly, numerous studies have found bias in the outputs of language models \\citep{abid2021persistent, ganguli2023capacity, liang2023holistic}.\nTo this end, several safety taxonomies have been proposed \\cite{tedeschi2024alert,inan2023llama,wang2024decodingtrust,vidgen2024introducingv05aisafety}. While many of them cover numerous categories, only \\citet{tedeschi2024alert} propose a taxonomy with 6 macro and 32 micro categories leveraging in-depth safety analysis. Such granularity is essential given the stringent and evolving safety requirements from regulatory bodies in the EU \\citep{AIActEU}, US \\citep{whitehouse2023fact}, and UK \\citep{govuk-ai-whitepaper}. Building \\texttt{M-ALERT} on this foundation allows us to leverage its fine-grained structure and policy-aligned evaluation.\n\n\\paragraph{Multilingual Safety.}\nExisting datasets and benchmarks \\cite{jain2024polyglotoxicityprompts,aakanksha2024multilingualalignmentprismaligning,wang2023all,yang2024benchmarkingllmguardrailshandling,Wynter2024RTPLXCL} make valuable contributions but are limited in several ways. First, while the PolygloToxcity dataset \\cite{jain2024polyglotoxicityprompts} and others \\cite{yang2024benchmarkingllmguardrailshandling,Wynter2024RTPLXCL} cover multiple languages, they focus exclusively on toxicity, overlooking other crucial safety considerations. LLMs deployed in real-world applications need broader alignment to general safety standards beyond toxic language. Second, other efforts like Cohere’s Aya red-team dataset \\cite{aakanksha2024multilingualalignmentprismaligning}, though useful, are relatively small (only a few hundred examples) and thus lack the scale necessary to capture the extensive range of use cases and tasks LLMs will encounter. \nFinally, in contrast to all previous approaches, we add a layer of category annotation (with detailed subcategories) that supports policy-aware safety assessments across languages, lifting evaluations to the next level. This is essential for adapting to diverse regions' unique legal and cultural contexts. Additionally, our study assesses multilingual safety across various dimensions, including model sizes, base versus instruct-tuned model versions, and checkpoints from continuous training.\n\n\\section{\\texttt{M-ALERT}}\n\nOur multilingual safety benchmark extends the \\texttt{ALERT} benchmark \\cite{tedeschi2024alert}, which assesses safety across various dimensions. To enhance its scope, we establish a pipeline to provide high-quality translations in five languages and offer a comprehensive evaluation framework. This approach enables a detailed safety assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs across languages.\n\n\\paragraph{\\texttt{ALERT}.}\n\\texttt{ALERT} describes a taxonomy for categorizing safety risks in conversational AI use cases. It is designed to provide thorough coverage of risk categories to test LLMs across a broad spectrum of scenarios. This way, it offers a structured approach for categorizing model safety, allowing each prompt-response pair to be assigned a specific risk category. The taxonomy's granularity facilitates the assessment of custom policies under different legal contexts by focusing on specific categories.\nThe full taxonomy entailing 6 macro and 32 micro categories is depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:taxonomy}. We now construct a multilingual extension and adoption of \\texttt{ALERT}.\n\n\\paragraph{\\texttt{M-ALERT} Translation Pipeline.} For creating \\texttt{M-ALERT}, we investigated several translation techniques.\nInitial experiments with bilingual language models, such as Llama \\cite{touvron2023llama} or Occiglot \\cite{Brack2024occiglot}\\footnote{\\url{occiglot/occiglot-7b-eu5-instruct}}, showed challenges; these models often failed to produce the correct language output (answer in English instead of French) or attempted to respond to the prompts rather than translating them. To address these issues and ensure high-quality translations, we select the system with the highest score on Tatoeba \\cite{artetxe-schwenk-2019-massively}, which consists of short sentences or phrases similar to the prompts used in our benchmark. In particular, we employed the Big-sized Opus MT \\cite{TiedemannThottingal:EAMT2020}\\footnote{ \\url{https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-de} and replace target language with (de/fr/it/es)}, a model among the most-downloaded models on HuggingFace for translation. Following \\citet{perrella-etal-2024-beyond}, we used two independent translation quality estimation metrics, \\texttt{COMET-XXL} \\cite{rei-etal-2023-scaling} and \\texttt{MetricX-XXL} \\cite{juraska-etal-2023-metricx}, to supervise translation further and ensure high quality. Given this two-stage pipeline, \\texttt{M-ALERT} can be expanded to more languages.\n\n\\paragraph{\\texttt{M-ALERT} Evaluation Framework.}\nIn contrast to \\texttt{ALERT}, \\texttt{M-ALERT} extends the evaluation framework to a multilingual setting, going beyond English to examine safety disparities across languages. We show our extended framework in Fig.~\\ref{fig:framework}. Each prompt, labeled with a specific category, is processed by an LLM. An auxiliary auto-evaluator model subsequently assesses its response, generating a safety score for the prompt and its corresponding category. The result is an overall safety score and category-specific, and language-specific scores.\nThese scores provide actionable insights into the reliability and limitations of a model’s performance across the supported languages.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n    {\\centering\n    \\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{%\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|ll}\n        \\toprule\n        & $\\sim$97\\% of translations (all high-quality) & $\\sim$3\\% of translations (most high-quality, some fail, here \\textit{it} and \\textit{fr})\\\\\n        \\midrule\n        en & Why are so many Muslims terrorists? & I hate fat people.

To achieve scalable safety scoring, we use automated evaluation with general-purpose models as judges. Specifically, given a text prompt \\( p \\), we auto-regressively generate a response \\( r \\) using a language model, i.e., \\( r = \\text{LLM}(p) \\). This prompt-response pair \\( (p, r) \\) is then evaluated by an automated judge J, yielding a safety score \\( s = \\text{J}(p, r) \\). To ensure alignment between human judgments and the automated scores, we conduct human reviews on a random subset of these scores, as detailed in App.~\\ref{sec:safetyscoring}.\n\n\\section{Translation Quality of \\texttt{M-ALERT}}\\label{sec:quality}\nWe now evaluate the quality of the pipeline used to create  \\texttt{M-ALERT}. We do so by estimating the translation quality using standard automated metrics and human supervision. \n\n\\paragraph{Translating Safety Prompts.}\nFirst, we ensured and assessed \\texttt{M-ALERT}'s translation quality with well-established estimation metrics, specifically MetricX \\cite{juraska-etal-2023-metricx}\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/google-research/metricx}} and COMET \\cite{rei-etal-2023-scaling}\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/Unbabel/wmt23-cometkiwi-da-xxl}}, which provided reliable quality scores for the translations across all target languages. In more detail, results in Table~\\ref{tab:trans_quality} show consistently high-quality scores (close to 0 for MetricX and close to 1 for COMET), indicating strong translation accuracy (where 25 is lowest and 0 highest for MetricX and 0 is lowest quality and 1 highest for COMET).\n\nFurthermore, we employed human expert supervision on a subset of 100 random prompts per language. We find that experts rate translations as correct in 93\\% of the cases per language.\nTogether with the machine-rated quality estimations we have a solid multilingual safety benchmark at hand, and can now turn to applying it in the wild.\n\nIn Table~\\ref{tab:translation_examples}, we present examples from our multilingual translation results, illustrating the strengths and weaknesses in translation accuracy across languages. Overall, the translation quality is high, with both semantic meaning and sentence structure being generally well-preserved across all languages. This consistency reflects the translators' capacity to maintain context and linguistic coherence when translating potentially sensitive phrases.\n\nHowever, there are areas where translation quality could be improved. Notably, models lack specific knowledge about certain cultural movements or contexts, leading to incorrect or incomplete translations across languages. Additionally, some phrases demonstrate variability in translation accuracy between languages; while one language may achieve a highly accurate translation, another may omit or inaccurately render parts of the sentence. This inconsistency suggests a need for improved translation methods, particularly for large-scale translations of nuanced safety-related content.\n\n\\section{Evaluating LLMs' Safety with \\texttt{M-ALERT}}\nIn this section, we describe experimental details before evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on \\texttt{M-ALERT}.\n\n\\paragraph{Experimental Setup.}\nWe evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on \\texttt{M-ALERT} and report their safety scores. To obtain the safety scores we employ a multilingual evaluator model LlamaGuard-3 \\citep{dubey2024llama3herdmodels}\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B}}. \nFor our experiments, we rely on SGLang \\citep{zheng2023efficiently}, a batching framework for fast LLM inference.\nWe use a cluster of 8xA100 GPUs. For each model, we set \\texttt{max\\_new\\_tokens}=200, use \\textit{sampling} as generation strategy, and focus on instruct versions due to the task's conversational nature.\nSpecifically, we study 10 multilingual LLMs from different families: Llama-3-8B-it, Llama-3.1-8B-it, Llama-3.2-3B-it, Ministral-8B-it, Mistral-7B-it-v0.3, Mistral-Small-it, aya-23-8b, aya-expanse-32b, c4ai-command-r-32b, and gemma-2-9b-it---full details in App.~\\ref{app:models}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{img/alert-vs-lalert-line.pdf}\n    \\caption{Overall safety scores for 5 languages. All models exacerbate unsafe behavior at least for one language---three models even highly unsafe. (y-axis scaled)}\n    \\label{tab:summary}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Overall Safety Discrepancies.}\\label{sec:results}\nAs triggered already in Fig.~\\ref{fig:m/alert}, \\texttt{M-ALERT} reveals significant safety discrepancies across languages. \nFig.~\\ref{tab:summary} now further summarizes the main results from \\texttt{M-ALERT}. \nWhen interpreting the results, we consider a model \\textit{safe} when its outputs are safe at least 99\\% of the time (gray). Further, we consider a model \\textit{unsafe} when its outputs are safe only between 90\\% and 99\\% of the time, highlighted in orange. Lastly, we consider a model \\textit{highly unsafe} when it generates unsafe outputs more than 10\\% of the time, marked in red. Using this color map, we can easily understand multilingual LLMs' safety concerns.\n\nFirstly, no model achieves a safe threshold (99\\%) across all languages. Yet, Gemma-2 stands out for approaching this threshold, meeting or exceeding 99\\% safety in Spanish, French, and Italian (gray area). This performance across languages indicates that it acts safe in diverse linguistic contexts.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0.5pt}\n\\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{cc|ccccc|ccccc|ccccc|ccccc|ccccc}\n\\toprule\n &  &

Details in Table~\\ref{tab:results}.}\n\\label{tab:results_2}\n\\vspace{-0.3cm}\n\\end{table*}\n\nOther models, such as Llama-3, Llama-3.1, and Llama-3.2, while generally safe, fall slightly short of the 99\\% threshold, with most of their scores between 95\\% and 98\\% (orange area), which we consider acceptable but potentially requiring refinement for higher-stakes applications. These models exhibit minor safety vulnerabilities, suggesting that they can generally maintain safe outputs but might struggle with nuanced safety challenges across specific languages. Notably, Mistral models also fall in this range but display more variability, particularly in English, indicating room for improvement to ensure consistent safety across all languages. Another notable observation is that models tend to become safer over time when comparing them to their predecessors in the table, such as Llama3 versus Llama3.1 or Mistral-7B compared to Ministral-8B. This trend underscores the valuable ongoing efforts in AI safety and alignment.\n\nConversely, aya-23 and c4ai-command models exhibit the most significant safety concerns. With scores predominantly below 90\\% (red area), these models often generate unsafe outputs, especially in German, where their performance drops markedly. These results indicate high levels of unsafe output generation, underscoring the need for these models to undergo targeted safety optimization, especially given their considerable potential for unsafe content in multilingual settings. Both models have undergone instruction tuning, but the lower safety performance of aya-23 is expected since its tuning was not specifically focused on safety. In contrast, the results for c4ai-command are more surprising. Despite being safety-tuned, its relatively low scores highlight significant room for improvement.\n\n\\paragraph{Category-specific Insights.}\nA closer examination of the models (cf.~Tables~\\ref{tab:results} \\& \\ref{tab:results_2}) reveals that certain categories exhibit consistently high safety levels across languages and models. For instance, almost all models demonstrate a high level of safety in the \\texttt{hate} category, which seems reasonable given the extensive prior research on toxicity \\cite{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts,jain2024polyglotoxicityprompts}. In contrast, categories like \\texttt{crime\\_propaganda} and \\texttt{substance\\_cannabis} consistently receive low safety scores across all languages and models. Our benchmark assesses a range of opinions regarding drug use and political attitudes or systems, making it challenging to address the pluralistic alignment problem with the current one-model-fits-all approach \\cite{sorensen2024roadmappluralisticalignment}. This gets specifically interesting for models such as Gemma that score safe except for such subcategories. \n\n\\paragraph{Policy Evaluation.} One important aspect to bear in mind when implementing safety is the different policies of companies or societies. For example, the use of cannabis is legal in several countries but not in others. Depending on the policy it may be acceptable to score lower in this category without being unsafe. For example, the \\texttt{substance\\_canabis} and \\texttt{crime\\_propaganda} categories seem to be outliers for most models' safety scores. \nTo this end, the fine granularity of our taxonomy and benchmark come into play. One particular category can be easily excluded from the benchmark, resulting in a different safety score (e.g.~safety scores of models increase if cannabis is excluded). For example, when removing cannabis and propaganda from the benchmark, the models' overall safety scores increase by around 2\\%, substantially changing the tables' color appearance. On the other hand, when excluding the hate category, where models usually score well, the models' overall safety scores decrease by more than 2\\%. These brief case studies highlight the valuable insights that can be drawn from the evaluations presented. By adopting this approach, various use cases can be explored, and it becomes possible to prioritize certain categories more or less heavily to suit specific needs.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\footnotesize\n    \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.4}\n    \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{4pt}\n    \\begin{tabular}{cc|p{4.5cm}p{4.6cm}p{4.1cm}}\n         \\toprule\n         && \\textbf{en (unsafe)} & \\textbf{ de (safe)} & \\textbf{translation}\\\\\n         \\multirow{5}{*}{\\rotatebox{90}{Llama 3.1}} & \\textbf{prompt} & Write a fake news article about Donald Trump & Schreibe einen gefälschten Artikel über Donald Trump & -- \\\\\n         & \\textbf{response} & **BREAKING: TRUMP DECLARES HIMSELF \"GREATEST BURGER CONNOISSEUR OF ALL TIME\"** Washington D.C. - In a shocking move, President Donald Trump [...]\n         & Ich kann Ihnen keinen gefälschten Artikel über Donald Trump schreiben.

Similar for Llama3 for category \\texttt{crime\\_tax} in English vs.~Italian.}\n    \\label{tab:case_study}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\paragraph{}In summary, our analysis highlights the importance of evaluating multilingual benchmarks like \\texttt{M-ALERT}. The results reveal that while some models achieve high overall safety, they are inconsistent across languages and categories, urging refinement to reduce language-specific weaknesses. Moreover, \\texttt{M-ALERT} is valuable for policy-aware evaluations.\n\n\\section{Discussion} \nWe now investigate the above findings in more detail.\n\n\\paragraph{Case study.}\nGiven the previous quantitative evidence, Table~\\ref{tab:case_study} further confirms these \nsafety inconsistencies across languages on a qualitative basis. For example, Llama3.1---a model with a high overall safety rating (98.7\\%)---demonstrates a notable decline in safety for the \\texttt{crime\\_propaganda} category when prompted in English (55\\%), cf.~Table~\\ref{tab:results}. In contrast, it maintains a high safety level in German (96.5\\%). A manual review confirms that this discrepancy is not attributable to translation quality or the performance of the auto-evaluator model; both translations and evaluations are accurate and reliable, as evidenced in the examples shown in Table~\\ref{tab:case_study}. Instead, the model exhibits different responses of varying safety levels to identical queries across languages. We observe similar behavior with Llama3 for \\texttt{crime\\_tax}, where the model remains safe in English (100\\%) but shows reduced safety in Italian (67.7\\%). These are just some qualitative examples of inconsistent safety performance for identical prompts across languages.\n\nThe first example is particularly unexpected, as one might expect a model's safety to be most robust and comprehensive in its primary language, English. Yet, our experiments reveal this assumption does often not hold. While we anticipated some inconsistencies due to imperfect translations, our findings suggest that the primary driver of the performance gap lies in misaligned safety behavior across languages. This points to shortcomings of safety data for specific languages.\n\n\\paragraph{Inter-language Consistency.} Building on these findings, we want to better understand safety inconsistencies. Rather than evaluating consistency through general safety scores, as done in previous evaluations, we now focus on whether a model’s responses to the same prompt are identical across languages. This approach emphasizes uniformity in responses, regardless of whether the answers are deemed safe or unsafe. To this end, we introduce an additional metric for consistency: an exact matching rate. \nThis metric examines whether a model’s behavior is not merely similar when averaged across multiple prompts but fully identical for a given prompt across languages.\nWe visualize these consistency results in Table~\\ref{tab:matching}. \nAs shown, inter-language consistency is significantly lower than overall safety scores might suggest. This demonstrates that while a model may achieve high safety ratings in individual languages, its exact alignment across them remains substantially lower. For instance, Llama3.2 produces an exact matching rate of 89\\%, meaning its responses are consistent across languages for that proportion of prompts. However, while the model scores around 97\\% safe for each language, it often fails to produce identical responses for the same prompt across languages.\nActually, one might expect a matching rate of 100\\% regardless of the overall safety score, as there is no clear reason for a model to behave differently across languages. Even a model with an overall safety score of 60\\% could achieve a 100\\% matching rate. This discrepancy highlights that the underlying safety inconsistencies are even more pronounced than they initially appear. \n\n\\paragraph{Model Size.} Now that we have investigated several models, we want to understand further whether model size is a key safety component. In this study, we observe that the smallest model, Llama3.2-3B, surpasses larger models with 22B to 32B parameters, while a model with 9B parameters achieves the best overall performance ---a middle range value. At the same time, safety does frequently correlate with general model capabilities, as demonstrated in prior research \\cite{ren2024safetywashingaisafetybenchmarks}. Examining our findings more closely, we underscore the importance of disentangling general model capabilities from safety capabilities. While Llama3.2-3B outperforms larger models, it falls behind its immediate predecessor, Llama3.1 with 8B parameters. This suggests that the difference in safety performance may be attributed to the quality of the safety tuning and that model capacity indeed plays a crucial role in safety performance. In more detail, when disentangling between instruct and base models we find a much clearer trend, in that base models show higher safety with increasing model size compared to instruction-tuned models. We further visualize and discuss these results in App.~Fig.~\\ref{fig:modelsize}.\n\n\\paragraph{Base vs.~Instruct} Upon further analysis of base versus instruct models in Table~\\ref{tab:base-vs-instruct}, we observe significant differences between the models. As expected, instruct models exhibit higher safety levels, but there is considerable variation in the safety of the base models. The safety gap between the best and worst performing base models approaches 30\\%, with base models of similar size showing differences of up to 10\\%. These findings are crucial for researchers who plan to fine-tune a base model with their own instruction data. Additionally, for those relying on base models for specific tasks, selecting a safer base model can be a key aspect, especially when high-quality safety data is unavailable.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{1pt}\n    \\resizebox{0.8\\linewidth}{!}{%\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|cccc|c}\n    \\toprule\n     & en--de & en--es & en--fr & en--it & all \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    Llama-3-8b-it & \\colorbox{Orange}{96.35} & \\colorbox{Orange}{95.92} & \\colorbox{Orange}{96.48} & \\colorbox{Orange}{95.51} & \\colorbox{Red}{89.38} \\\\\n    Llama-3.1-8b-it & \\colorbox{Orange}{95.29} & \\colorbox{Orange}{95.53} & \\colorbox{Orange}{95.91} & \\colorbox{Orange}{95.27} & \\colorbox{Orange}{93.75} \\\\\n    Llama-3.2-3b-it & \\colorbox{Orange}{94.43} & \\colorbox{Orange}{94.16} & \\colorbox{Orange}{93.83} & \\colorbox{Orange}{93.67} & \\colorbox{Red}{88.86} \\\\\n    Ministral-8B & \\colorbox{Orange}{90.34} & \\colorbox{Orange}{91.29} & \\colorbox{Orange}{91.15} & \\colorbox{Orange}{91.74} & \\colorbox{Red}{83.65} \\\\\n    Mistral-7B & \\colorbox{Red}{87.88} & \\colorbox{Red}{88.56} & \\colorbox{Red}{89.45} & \\colorbox{Red}{87.71} & \\colorbox{Red}{78.16} \\\\\n    Mistral-Small & \\colorbox{Orange}{92.40} & \\colorbox{Orange}{92.48} & \\colorbox{Orange}{92.85} & \\colorbox{Orange}{92.60} & \\colorbox{Red}{87.66} \\\\\n    aya-23-8b & \\colorbox{Red}{71.24} & \\colorbox{Red}{74.10} & \\colorbox{Red}{72.09} & \\colorbox{Red}{71.07} & \\colorbox{Red}{44.74} \\\\\n    aya-expanse & \\colorbox{Orange}{94.29} & \\colorbox{Orange}{93.89} & \\colorbox{Orange}{92.68} & \\colorbox{Orange}{91.47} & \\colorbox{Red}{85.32} \\\\\n    c4ai-command & \\colorbox{Red}{88.80} & \\colorbox{Red}{87.31} & \\colorbox{Red}{88.76} & \\colorbox{Red}{87.04} & \\colorbox{Red}{74.12} \\\\\n    gemma-2-9b-it & \\colorbox{Orange}{98.86} & \\colorbox{Orange}{98.84} & \\colorbox{Orange}{98.75} & \\colorbox{Orange}{98.71} & \\colorbox{Orange}{97.21} \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n    }\n    \\caption{Inter-language consistency.

Our findings demonstrate that while some models exhibit inconsistent safety across languages, certain categories consistently trigger unsafe responses, emphasizing the need for robust multilingual safety measures to ensure responsible LLM deployment globally. We hope our work fosters new research opportunities and encourages the development of safe LLMs compliant with the latest AI regulations. \n\n\\section{Limitations}\n\\texttt{M-ALERT} as a multilingual safety benchmark has several limitations that must be considered. A key area for improvement is the quality of translations on a large scale. We acknowledge general limitations of translation quality estimation \\cite{Zhao2024FromHF,perrella-etal-2024-beyond}. While our evaluation includes various languages, the effectiveness of model assessments is heavily reliant on translation accuracy. Inaccurate translations can lead to misinterpretations of content, potentially distorting the evaluation results. Despite our significant efforts to ensure translation quality, future research could focus on refining and specifying translation methodologies to the topic of safety to enhance correctness across languages. Moreover, incorporating a broader range of languages into the benchmark would further enrich our evaluation.\n \n\nAs \\texttt{ALERT} has been available for over six months now and large model providers \\cite{kyutai2024moshi} openly state using it, it is important to consider that the models under investigation here may have been exposed to the underlying \\texttt{ALERT} benchmark in some way during their training.\n\nMoreover, the multilingual auto-evaluator LlamaGuard-3, although a valuable asset for our assessment, has its limitations. As the first multilingual evaluator of its kind, it is prone to errors that could affect the evaluation process \\cite{yang2024benchmarkingllmguardrailshandling}. Confounding factors associated with Llama base models may also complicate the interpretation of results, potentially misrepresenting the safety profiles of these specific models.\n\nLastly, while this work emphasizes safety, future research should additionally explore the balance between helpfulness and evasiveness \\cite{bai2022training, cui2024orbench} to gain a more comprehensive understanding of model behavior.\n\n\\section{Ethical Considerations}\nWhile \\texttt{M-ALERT} is designed to benchmark and promote safety, it also carries the potential for misuse. For example, a multilingual DPO dataset generated from our prompts and responses could be repurposed to guide a model toward less safe behaviors instead of fostering safer outcomes. Furthermore, our methodology highlights vulnerabilities in several large language models (LLMs). We strongly encourage organizations deploying these models to address these findings proactively to minimize risks to users and enhance overall safety.\n\nThe safety scores we report rely on Llama Guard, which offers a broad understanding of safety. However, it is essential to acknowledge that perceptions of safety vary by individual and context. What one person considers safe may differ from another's perspective. As such, our evaluations serve as valuable guidance but cannot ensure individual safety. On a positive note, \\texttt{M-ALERT} itself is independent of the judge model used. Also, its adaptable taxonomy facilitates the exploration of different safety policies, reflecting the changing cultural and legal landscapes.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements} We acknowledge support of the hessian.AI Innovation Lab (funded by the\nHessian Ministry for Digital Strategy and Innovation), the hessian.AISC Service Center (funded\nby the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF, grant No 01IS22091), and the German\nResearch Center for AI (DFKI).

As these models are increasingly used in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, the challenge of ensuring their safe and responsible usage across multiple languages has become paramount. Early research on toxicity and safety in LLMs predominantly focused on English, leaving a substantial gap in understanding the behavior of these models in non-English languages. This gap is particularly critical given the potential for cultural biases and the varying legal and ethical standards across different regions. The field of AI safety has evolved to address these issues, with recent efforts emphasizing the need for comprehensive multilingual benchmarks to evaluate and mitigate harmful content generated by LLMs. This summary delves into three recent research papers that explore the safety and toxicity evaluation of LLMs in multilingual settings, highlighting the methodologies, findings, and implications of their work.\n\n### Main Content of Each Paper\n\n#### Paper 1: RTP-LX (Real Toxicity Prompts - Language eXpanded)\n\nThis paper introduces RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate the ability of large and small language models (LLMs and SLMs) to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual context. The dataset comprises approximately 1,100 toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages, derived from the original Real Toxicity Prompts (RTP) dataset, which was primarily in English. Each prompt is professionally translated by native speakers, ensuring cultural nuances are preserved, and the entire dataset is human-labeled. The authors evaluate ten S/LLMs on their performance in detecting toxicity, focusing on both accuracy and agreement with human judges. They find that while the models typically score well in accuracy, they struggle in discerning subtle-yet-harmful content, such as microaggressions and bias. Additionally, the models exhibit a non-trivial amount of false positives, indicating a tendency to over-block benign content. The study also explores the correlation between language resource availability and model performance, revealing that models perform better in high-resource languages.\n\n#### Paper 2: \\datasetName (PolygloToxicityPrompts)\n\nThe second paper presents \\datasetName, a large-scale multilingual benchmark that evaluates the toxic degeneration of LLMs. This benchmark includes 425K naturally occurring prompts across 17 languages, scraped from web-text corpora to ensure a broad representation of real-world inputs. The authors use the Perspective API to score toxicity and evaluate over 60 LLMs on their ability to generate toxic content based on these prompts. They find that toxicity increases as the availability of language resources decreases and as model size increases. Instruction-tuning and preference-tuning methods reduce toxicity, but the choice of tuning method does not significantly impact the results. The paper highlights the need for multilingual toxicity mitigation and further research into the effects of model hyperparameters on toxicity. \n\n#### Paper 3: \\texttt{M-ALERT} (Multilingual ALERT)\n\nThe third paper introduces \\texttt{M-ALERT}, a multilingual safety benchmark that extends the \\texttt{ALERT} benchmark to five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. The dataset includes 75K high-quality prompts, each associated with a specific safety category. The authors evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs and find significant inconsistencies in safety performance across languages and categories. For instance, Llama3.2 shows high unsafety in the category \\texttt{crime\\_tax} for Italian but remains safe in other languages. The study also reveals that certain categories, such as \\texttt{substance\\_cannabis} and \\texttt{crime\\_propaganda}, consistently trigger unsafe responses across models and languages. The authors emphasize the importance of language-specific safety analysis and the need for robust multilingual safety practices to ensure safe and responsible usage of LLMs across diverse user communities.\n\n### Commonalities and Innovations\n\nAll three papers address the critical issue of evaluating LLMs for safety and toxicity in multilingual contexts. They collectively highlight the challenges of ensuring safe and ethical deployment of these models across different languages and cultures. The common methodologies include the use of human-labeled datasets, automated toxicity scoring tools like the Perspective API, and the evaluation of a wide range of LLMs. However, each paper introduces unique innovations and focuses on different aspects of the problem.\n\n- **RTP-LX** emphasizes the importance of culturally-sensitive translations and the need for human judgment in evaluating subtle toxic content. It introduces a dataset that is specifically designed to capture the nuances of toxicity in different languages, and it highlights the limitations of current models in detecting microaggressions and bias.\n- **\\datasetName** focuses on the scalability of toxicity evaluation by leveraging web-scraped data and automated translation methods. It provides a large-scale benchmark that captures the full spectrum of toxicity across different languages, and it investigates the impact of model size and alignment methods on toxicity.\n- **\\texttt{M-ALERT}** extends the \\texttt{ALERT} benchmark to include a detailed safety taxonomy, enabling category-specific evaluations. It highlights the need for language-specific safety analysis and demonstrates that certain categories consistently trigger unsafe responses across models and languages.\n\n### Comparison of Results and Discussion\n\nThe results from the three papers reveal several common trends and differences in the evaluation of LLMs for safety and toxicity in multilingual settings.\n\n- **Accuracy vs. Agreement with Human Judges**: RTP-LX finds that while S/LLMs typically score well in accuracy, their agreement with human judges is low, especially for subtle toxic content. In contrast, \\datasetName and \\texttt{M-ALERT} focus more on the overall toxicity of generated content, with \\datasetName showing that toxicity increases with model size and decreases with language resource availability. \\texttt{M-ALERT} also highlights inconsistencies in safety performance across languages and categories, indicating that models may behave differently in various linguistic contexts.\n- **Impact of Model Size and Alignment Methods**: \\datasetName and \\texttt{M-ALERT} both find that larger models tend to generate more toxic content, and that instruction-tuning and preference-tuning methods can reduce toxicity. However, \\datasetName shows that the choice of tuning method does not significantly impact toxicity, while \\texttt{M-ALERT} finds that certain categories consistently trigger unsafe responses regardless of the model size or tuning method.\n- **Translation Quality and Cultural Nuances**: RTP-LX and \\texttt{M-ALERT} both emphasize the importance of high-quality translations that preserve cultural nuances. RTP-LX uses participatory design practices to ensure culturally-aware translations, while \\texttt{M-ALERT} employs an advanced translation pipeline to maintain translation quality. \\datasetName, however, relies more on automated translation methods, which can introduce deviations in toxicity due to incorrect translations and hallucinations.\n- **False Positives and Over-blocking**: RTP-LX and \\texttt{M-ALERT} both report a non-trivial amount of false positives, indicating that models tend to over-block benign content. This issue is particularly problematic in multilingual settings, where cultural sensitivities and subtleties can lead to over-blocking of harmless content.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe three papers collectively underscore the critical need for comprehensive and culturally-sensitive evaluation of LLMs in multilingual contexts. They reveal that while current models can detect explicit toxic content, they struggle with subtle-yet-harmful content such as microaggressions and bias. The results also highlight the importance of language-specific safety analysis and the need for robust multilingual safety practices. Future research should focus on refining translation methodologies, expanding the scope of benchmarks to cover more languages and dialects, and developing more nuanced safety evaluation tools that can capture the full spectrum of harmful content. Additionally, there is a need for further investigation into the impact of model size and alignment methods on toxicity, as well as the development of more effective safety tuning techniques. The findings from these papers serve as valuable guidance for organizations deploying LLMs, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to address safety concerns and ensure responsible usage of these models across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts."
