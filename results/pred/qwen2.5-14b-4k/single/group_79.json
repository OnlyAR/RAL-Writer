ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings;  instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11\\% faster and using 11\\% less memory. \nALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.%\n\\footnote{Code \\& models: \\url{https://github.com/ofirpress/attention_with_linear_biases}}\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\nWhen constructing a transformer-based language model, a major design decision is the length of training sequences, denoted $L$ herein, which has to date  been equivalent to the length of inference sequences.  More context, achieved by larger $L$, improves predictions at inference time.  But longer sequences are more expensive to train on.\\footnote{Figure~\\ref{fig:wt103_train_speeds_all} in the appendix plots training speed, in words per second, against $L$.}  \n\nBefore transformers, RNN language models were trained on shorter-$L$ sequences and assumed to generalize to longer contexts at inference time~\\citep{Mikolov2010RecurrentNN, Mikolov2012ContextDR, zaremba2014recurrent}.  \\citet{vaswani}, introducing the transformer, speculated that it ``may [...] extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.''  \nWe define \\emph{extrapolation} as a model's ability to continue performing well as the number of input tokens during validation increases beyond the number of tokens on which the the model was trained. \nWe find that transformer language models (LMs)  that use sinusoidal position embeddings have very weak  %\nextrapolation abilities; see Figure~\\ref{fig:wt103_extra}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}{.5\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/wt103_extra_512.pdf}\n\\end{subfigure}%\n\\begin{subfigure}{.5\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/wt103_extra_1024.pdf}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{Extrapolation:\nas the (validation-set's) input sequence gets longer ($x$-axis), current position methods (sinusoidal, rotary, and T5) show degraded perplexity ($y$-axis, lower is better), but our method (\\S\\ref{sec:ourmethod}) does not.  Models were trained on WikiText-103 with sequences of $L=$ 512 (left) or $L=$ 1,024 (right) tokens.  T5 ran out of memory on our 32GB GPU. For more detail on exact perplexities and runtimes, see Tables~\\ref{tab:appendix:wt103_extra_512} and~\\ref{tab:appendix:wt103_extra_1024} in the appendix.}\n\n\\label{fig:wt103_extra}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe demonstrate that this failure to extrapolate is caused by the position embedding method.  As shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:wt103_extra}, recent alternatives to the original sinusoidal position method \\citep{roformer,t5} have improved extrapolation.  However, the better of these, the T5 bias, is considerably slower than the sinusoidal approach and uses extra memory and parameters (Figure~\\ref{fig:wt103_speed_mem}).\n\nWe therefore introduce Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) to facilitate  efficient extrapolation. %\nALiBi negatively biases attention scores with a linearly decreasing penalty proportional to the distance between the relevant key and query. Our simple approach eliminates position embeddings. %\n\nCompared to a sinusoidal model trained on the same input length, our method requires no additional runtime or parameters and incurs a negligible (0--0.7\\%) memory increase.  ALiBi can be implemented by changing only a few lines of existing transformer code. \n\nUsing ALiBi, a transformer LM can be trained on short-$L$ sequences and therefore at much lower cost, and it can still be reliably applied to long sequences at runtime. For example, a 1.3 billion parameter LM trained on $L=$ 1024 tokens with ALiBi achieves the same perplexity as a sinusoidal model trained on $L=$ 2048 when both are tested on sequences of 2048 tokens, even though \\textit{our model is 11\\% faster and uses 11\\% less memory. }%\n\nThough performance peaks at around two times the number of tokens that the model was trained on, ALiBi maintains strong performance even on sequences of length 10,000. \nIn recently explored settings where NLP training examples are given as context to an LM \\citep{gpt3}, our approach will allow exposure to more examples. Additionally, it enables generation of longer outputs.\n\n\\section{Current Approaches Do Not Extrapolate Efficiently }\n\\label{sec:act2}\n\n \n\nWe show for the first time that the sinusoidal position method, which technically should be able to extrapolate, in practice has very limited extrapolation capabilities. Though the rotary position method improves over the sinusoidal one, it still does not achieve satisfying results.  Holding everything else constant, we are the first to observe that the T5 bias method leads to better extrapolation than either of these, and so we conclude that extrapolation ability depends heavily on the position embedding.  Unfortunately, the T5 bias is computationally costly (Figure~\\ref{fig:wt103_speed_mem}).\n\n\\subsection{Background and Experimental Setup}\n\nA transformer LM receives a list of tokens \nand outputs a probability distribution representing its prediction for the next token.  We call the input list the \\textit{current input subsequence} since the inputs to language models are typically subsequences from (much longer) training or evaluation sequences.  During both training and perplexity evaluation (i.e., scoring a fixed sequence), many predictions can be calculated at once; this is done using a ``causal mask'' that ensures each position's prediction is influenced only by tokens to its left.  Let $L$ be the length of each input subsequence during training; it includes $L$ predictions, which on average have access to $\\frac{L+1}{2}$ tokens of (left) context.  %\nTo explore a model's extrapolation abilities, we are interested in cases where sequences of length $L_{\\textit{valid}} > L$ are considered at evaluation time. %\nWhen $L$ differs between inference and training, we use \\lt to refer to the length of subsequences during training and \\li  to refer to their length at validation. \n\n\\paragraph{Nonoverlapping Inference}\nTo train on or evaluate a sequence longer than $L$ tokens, it is typical to segment the sequence into $L$-length subsequences and train on or evaluate them independently.  Unless otherwise stated, we use nonoverlapping inference to report perplexity scores. %\n\n\\paragraph{Extrapolation During Inference} \nFormally, the functions that define a transformer layer are agnostic to input length;\\footnote{These include the embedding lookup, feedforward sublayer, and softmax layer, which act independently on vector inputs, as well as the attention sublayers, whose parameters do not depend on input length (and which must handle variable-length inputs, e.g., due to causal masking).  %\n} they map from some arbitrary, unfixed number of input vectors to the same number of output vectors.  When transformers are applied to data that is inherently sequential, like text, %\npositional information is injected into the inputs in various ways. \n\n\\citet{vaswani}\ndiscussed two options for embedding positions into vectors to be added to word %\nembeddings:  learning embeddings for specific positions and unlearned sinusoidal embeddings.  They observed similar performance between these two but preferred the sinusoidal approach, which they argued might extrapolate to longer input sequences during inference.  %\nWe find that this model cannot extrapolate to more than a few dozen tokens beyond $L$.\\footnote{The learned positional embedding approach does not have a way to encode positions greater than $L$; it therefore has no ability to extrapolate.}\n\n\\paragraph{Experiment Setup}\nWe first test the extrapolation abilities of various position methods on the WikiText-103 corpus~\\citep{pointer} using the transformer language model of~\\cite{baevski}. \nWe use this model because of its prominent role in recent  language modeling developments~\\citep{khandelwal20generalization, shortformer}. The training set is about 103 million tokens from  English Wikipedia (half a gigabyte).  The  model has $16$ transformer layers of dimension $1024$, with $8$ heads, and a feedforward inner dimension of $4096$. This model ties the word embedding and softmax matrices~\\citep{tying, inan2017}. %\nIn our experiments, other than varying the position method and training subsequence length, we modify no other hyperparameters, including the random seed and number of training epochs (205). \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}{.28\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/wt103_Training-Speed.pdf}\n\\end{subfigure}%\n\\begin{subfigure}{.28\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/wt103_Inference-Speed.pdf}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\begin{subfigure}{.28\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/wt103_Training-Memory-Usage.pdf}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\begin{subfigure}[]{.14\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\raisebox{3mm}{\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/legend.pdf}}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{A comparison of batched training, inference speed and memory use of the sinusoidal, rotary, T5 bias, and our ALiBi position methods. The speed differences between our method and the sinusoidal are within 1\\% during training and 3\\% for inference, which is insignificant on our hardware. ALiBi uses 100MB of extra memory when training on input lengths 1024 and 3072 in this setting. Memory usage is lower in all approaches when training on 3072 tokens (compared to 1024) since we break batches into multiple updates. See Table~\\ref{tab:baselines_speed_mem} in the appendix for exact numbers. \n}\n\\label{fig:wt103_speed_mem}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Measuring Extrapolation}\n\\paragraph{Sinusoidal Position Embeddings}\nSinusoidal position embeddings (\\citealp{vaswani}; \\S 3.5) are constant, non-learned vectors that are added to token embeddings on input to the first layer of the transformer. They are frequently used in transformer language modeling~\\citep{baevski,lewis2021base} and machine translation~\\citep{vaswani,ott2018scaling} models. \nWe first consider the unmodified model of~\\cite{baevski}, which uses sinusoidal position embeddings, and train it on $L=512$ tokens; we then run inference with it on the validation set on $L+k$ tokens, with $k$ ranging from 0 to 15,000.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:wt103_extra} (left) and the corresponding Table~\\ref{tab:appendix:wt103_extra_512} (in the appendix) show that while the model improves  perplexity up to $k=20$, performance stops improving and stays steady from $k=20$ to $k=50$ and then begins degrading. \nSimilar results are obtained for a model trained with $L=1024$ tokens (Figure~\\ref{fig:wt103_extra} (right) and Table~\\ref{tab:appendix:wt103_extra_1024} in the appendix). That model improves for up to $\\li = \\lt + 50$ tokens, after which performance declines. \n\n\\paragraph{Rotary Position Embeddings}\nThe rotary method was introduced by~\\cite{roformer} and has recently been popularized by the open source GPT-3~\\citep{gpt3} implementation GPT-J~\\citep{gpt-j}. Instead of adding sinusoidal embeddings at the bottom of the transformer, they multiply the keys and queries of every attention layer by sinusoidal embeddings. \n\nUnlike the sinusoidal or learned positional embedding approach, the rotary method injects position information into the model at every layer, not just at the initial one.  In addition, it adds no position information to the values of the self-attention sublayer. The output of a self-attention sublayer is a linearly transformed, weighted sum of the input value vectors; therefore, by not inserting position information into the values, the outputs of each transformer-layer contain no explicit position information. \nWe suspect that this segregation of position information may be beneficial for extrapolation, and we draw inspiration from it in the design of our method (\\S\\ref{sec:ourmethod}).\n\nWe apply the rotary position embedding method to our Baevski \\& Auli baseline.\\footnote{Our rotary method implementation is based on the code in \\url{https://github.com/JunnYu/RoFormer_pytorch}, which is linked to from the official repository of~\\cite{roformer}: (\\url{https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer}). After we finished running our experiments with the rotary method, we were informed that the runtime of the code linked above could be optimized, making it only 2\\% slower than the sinusoidal approach. This optimization would not change extrapolation performance.}\nThe perplexity results (Figure~\\ref{fig:wt103_extra} and Appendix Tables~\\ref{tab:appendix:wt103_extra_512} and~\\ref{tab:appendix:wt103_extra_1024}) are better than the sinusoidal approach: the model with $L=512$ ($L=1024$) improves perplexity with up to $k=200$ ($k=100$) more tokens than it saw during training, but this comes at the cost of slower training and inference (Figure~\\ref{fig:wt103_speed_mem}). %\n\n\\paragraph{T5 Bias}\nThough most models use trained or sinusoidal position embeddings, the T5 model of~\\cite{t5} uses a relative position method~\\citep{shaw,Huang2019MusicTG} that adds no  position information to word embeddings (as in the previous method). Instead, it  %\nmodifies the way attention values are computed. We refer to this as the ``T5 bias'' method.\\footnote{This method is similar to the one used in~\\citet[Equation 7]{parikh-etal-2016-decomposable}.} To compute attention values in the unmodified transformer, we compute the dot product of every query with every relevant key %\nand then softmax these attention values. In this method, we compute the attention values as before, %\nbut then we add a learned, shared bias to each query-key score that is dependent on just the distance between the query and key. Therefore, all query-key scores where the query and key distance are zero (i.e., the query and key represent the same token) get a specific learned bias, all scores where the query and key are one word away get a different learned bias, and so on, up to a certain point, from where multiple different distances share the same learned bias (which might be beneficial for extrapolation). %\nAs in the rotary method, the T5 bias injects position information into the model at every layer and integrates no explicit position information into the %\nself-attention value vectors. \n\n\\cite{t5} propose that the T5 bias may allow extrapolation, but they did not report experiments testing this.  Here, we show that the T5 bias does allow language models to extrapolate.\nWe do this by again modifying the Baevski \\& Auli model, this time to insert the T5 bias into it.\\footnote{Our T5 bias implementation is based on the one used in HuggingFace Transformers~\\citep{huggingface}, which in turn is based on the official Mesh Tensorflow T5 code. }\n\nAs Figure~\\ref{fig:wt103_extra} shows, the T5 bias improves perplexity with longer sequences than the ones it was trained on, i.e.,  $k=600$ ($k=800$) extra tokens for a model trained on $L=512$ ($L=1024$) input tokens.  Unfortunately, this impressive performance comes at a cost: training is at least twice as slow as with the sinusoidal model. Therefore, this model's extrapolation ability provides no efficiency advantage. For example, to do inference on 1024 tokens, we could either train the sinusoidal model with \\lt = 1024 or train the T5 bias model on \\lt = 512 tokens and extrapolate to 1024 for inference. However, the \\lt = 1024 sinusoidal model runs at 28.5k words per second (WPS), while the \\lt = 512 T5 bias model runs at 14.4k WPS (Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:baselines_speed_mem}), so there is no speedup when training on shorter sequences with this method.\\footnote{ \\citet{narang2021transformer} benchmarked the T5 bias as being just 8.7\\% slower than the sinusoidal approach; thus,   while always incurring a runtime penalty, this method's runtime could be faster depending on the choice of hardware and software frameworks used. Narang et al. used the Tensorflow T5 library running on TPUs, while we used the PyTorch Fairseq library running on GPUs. }\n\n\\section{Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi)}\n\\label{sec:ourmethod}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=.48\\textwidth]{figures/fig1.pdf} %\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{When computing attention scores for each head, our linearly biased attention method, ALiBi,  adds a constant bias (right) to each attention score ($\\mathbf{q}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_j$, left). As in the unmodified attention sublayer, the softmax function is then applied to these scores, and the rest of the computation is unmodified. \\textbf{$\\textbf{m}$ is a head-specific scalar} that is set and not learned throughout training. We show that our method for setting $m$ values generalizes to multiple text domains, models and training compute budgets. %\nWhen using ALiBi, we do \\emph{not} add positional embeddings at the bottom of the network.  }\n\\label{fig:1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn the transformer model of \\citet{vaswani}, position embeddings are added to the word embeddings at the bottom of the network. %\nFor an input subsequence of length $L$, the attention sublayer %\ncomputes the attention scores for the $i$th\nquery $\\mathbf{q}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1\\times d}$, ($1 \\leq i \\leq L$) in each head, given the first $i$ keys $\\mathbf{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{i\\times d}$, where $d$ is the head dimension:%\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{q}_i \\mathbf{K}^\\top)\n\\end{equation*}\nThese attention scores are then multiplied by the values to return the output of the attention sublayer.\\footnote{For simplicity we omit the key, query, value and final output projections, dropout, and the scaling factor.}\n\nWhen using ALiBi, we do not add position embeddings at any point in the network. %\nThe only modification we apply is after the query-key dot product, where we add a static, non-learned bias:\\footnote{The ALiBi bias is not multiplied by the $\\sqrt{d_k}$ scaling factor from Equation 1 of~\\citet{vaswani}.}\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{q}_i \\mathbf{K}^\\top + m \\cdot [-(i-1), ..., -2, -1, 0]), \n\\end{equation*}\nwhere scalar $m$ is a head-specific slope fixed before training.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:1} offers a visualization. \n\nFor our models with 8 heads, the slopes that we used are the geometric sequence: %\n${\\frac{1}{2^1}, \\frac{1}{2^2}, ..., \\frac{1}{2^8}}$. \nFor models that require 16 heads, we interpolate those 8 slopes by geometrically averaging every consecutive pair, resulting in the geometric sequence that starts at $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and has the ratio of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$: ${\\frac{1}{2^{0.5}}, \\frac{1}{2^1}, \\frac{1}{2^{1.5}}, ..., \\frac{1}{2^{8}}}$. In general, for $n$ heads, our set of slopes is the geometric sequence that starts at %\n$2^{\\frac{-8}{n}}$\nand uses that same value as its ratio.  \n\nIn \\S\\ref{sec:results}, we observe that this set of slopes works on a wide variety of text domains and model sizes. Therefore, we do not believe that it is necessary to tune these slope values every time a new model is trained on a new dataset. This makes our method similar to the sinusoidal approach, where the hyperparameters (the start and end of the geometric progression of wavelengths) were set once by~\\citet{vaswani} and then reused in different models of different sizes on different datasets.  \n\n\\al has an inductive bias towards recency; it penalizes attention scores between distant query-key pairs, with the penalty increasing as the distance between a key and a query grows. The different heads increase their penalties at different rates, depending on the slope magnitude. \n\nWe initially experimented with making the slopes trainable, but this did not yield strong extrapolation results.\\footnote{In our experiments, trainable slopes also slowed down the training speed by 3\\%.} %\nA brief manual exploration of around ten slope sets led us to discover the set of slopes that we finally picked. Our main insight from this exploration is that the slope sets that work best are those with slopes in the $(0,1)$ range, with the slopes' density increasing as we get closer to $0$. \nWe also found our method to be robust to slope choice. Even randomly sampling from the exponential distribution worked well in some cases (although that method had high variance). %\n\nSince ALiBi is a relative position method, we add position information at every layer to the keys and queries but not to the values, as is done in the T5 bias and rotary methods. We hypothesize that these properties might be beneficial for extrapolation. %\n\n\\paragraph{Implementation.}\nALiBi is easy to implement, with all changes accomplished in a few lines of code. We implement it by modifying the mask matrix by adding the linear biases to it (in practice, when training a transformer LM, query $\\mathbf{q}_i$ attends only to keys $1$ to $i$; this is implemented by adding a mask matrix to the query-key dot product before the softmax operation is applied). This means that there is no runtime penalty when using our method since we add no operations to the network.%\n\nCompared to the sinusoidal model trained on the same input lengths, AliBi incurs a memory increase (up to 100MB in some of our experiments): in the unmodified transformer, the mask is of size $L\\times L$; when using ALiBi, the mask is a slightly larger $n \\times L\\times L$ (where $n$ is the number of heads) since the linear biases added for each head uses a different slope. But, as we show, ALiBi enables training on much smaller sequences while still achieving (and occasionally surpassing) results obtained using sinusoidal embeddings on longer sequences, which saves multiple gigabytes of memory. \n\\section{Results}\n\\label{sec:results}\nWe first show that on WikiText103 ALiBi is efficient and enables training models with short input subsequences that outperform strong baselines even when the ALiBi models extrapolate to more than six times the number of tokens that they were trained on. \nWe then take the same hyperparameters for our method (the set of slopes) that worked on WikiText-103 and show that -- with no modification -- they provide strong results on a dataset in a very different domain: books. \nFinally, we show that a 1.3B parameter model trained with AliBi on a much larger (461 GB) dataset with much more compute provides a superior alternative to the sinusoidal method since it achieves similar perplexity scores while running faster and using less memory (since it is trained on shorter inputs). \n\nWhile multiple alternatives to the position methods presented in~\\cite{vaswani} have been proposed, few have been adopted in large (1B or more parameter) LMs since  that setting is much more challenging than the smaller scale experiments. GPT-3 and Jurassic-1~\\citep{J1WhitePaper} use the learned position embedding method from Vaswani et al., and GPT-J uses the rotary method.\nOur results on the 1.3B parameter model show our method's ability to generalize to larger models, dataset sizes and training durations without retuning the hyperparameter. \n\n\\subsection{Results on WikiText-103 and Toronto BookCorpus}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=.65\\textwidth]{figures/wt103_extra_lsb_all.pdf} %\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\al models trained and evaluated on varying sequence lengths on the WikiText-103 validation set and the sinusoidal baseline (not evaluated on longer sequences). All of our models outperform the sinusoidal ones even when trained on fewer tokens. Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:LSB_wt103} has exact perplexities, more \\al models (trained on fewer tokens), and results for rotary and T5 bias models. }\n\\label{fig:wt103_extra_lsb_all}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe first develop our method on the WikiText-103 corpus~\\citep{pointer}, replacing the sinusoidal position embeddings in the language model of~\\cite{baevski} with \\al. \n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:wt103_extra_lsb_all} (and the corresponding Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:LSB_wt103}) show our results for models trained with varying numbers of input subsequence tokens ($L$), extrapolating to longer subsequence lengths on the validation dataset. \nOur first observation is that, without extrapolation, for every $L$, our models outperform  those using the sinusoidal method, sometimes by a  significant %\namount. For example, the Baevski \\& Auli model achieves 18.67$\\pm$0.24 (std.~dev.) perplexity when trained with $L = 3072$ input tokens, but our $L=3072$ model achieves 17.60 perplexity (when both models evaluate with \\li = 3072).\n\nOur second observation is that all of our models can extrapolate, and they obtain improved perplexity scores when handling more tokens than they observed during training. For example, our model trained on 512 tokens (which achieves 19.73 perplexity when evaluating subsequences of length 512 in the development set) achieves a perplexity score of 18.40 on the development set when extrapolating to subsequences of length 3072. Surprisingly, this surpasses the score that the $L=3072$ sinusoidal model obtains on the development set by a statistically significant margin. \nNote that all our models trained on $L=512$ to $L=2048$ outperform the sinusoidal baseline trained on $L=3072$ when extrapolating to \\li = 3072 even though those models all take much less time to train since they train on shorter subsequences (Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:wt103_train_speed_vs_ppl} compares training speed to perplexity for these models)! The $L=512$ model is 1.84 times faster to train and yet still outperforms the $L=3072$ sinusoidal model when extrapolating to $\\li = 3072$. In addition, training the $L=3072$ sinusoidal model requires a GPU with more than 16 GB of memory to fit the large attention matrices, which our $L=512$ outperforms even though it can be trained on a GPU with much less memory due to much smaller attention matrices. \n\nAdditionally,  Table~\\ref{tab:LSB_wt103} (in the appendix) also shows that, for $L$s  of 1024 and 3072, our method performs better than the rotary and T5 bias models even when \\li = $L$ (i.e., no extrapolation is occurring).\nFigure~\\ref{fig:wt103_extra} (and the corresponding Appendix Tables~\\ref{tab:appendix:wt103_extra_512} and~\\ref{tab:appendix:wt103_extra_1024}) more broadly explore our method vs.~the other position methods. They show that the T5 bias (the best of the baselines) improves perplexity until \\li is around $2L$, but on the WikiText-103 dataset our method continually improves perplexity until at least around $3L$, with the $L=512$ model improving perplexity even when \\li exceeds 12k tokens. Even when unable to improve perplexity given longer sequences, \\al always maintains strong performance as more tokens are added. \n\nAppendix Table~\\ref{tab:wt103_test} shows that our results on the validation set also transfer to the test set of WikiText-103.\nCurrently, almost all models that present results on WikiText-103 use sliding window evaluation  (defined in \\S\\ref{sec:analysis}) to compute perplexities. We apply that method to our (and to the sinusoidal, rotary and T5 bias) models in Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:wt103_test_sota}. We find that our L = 3072 model surpasses the performance of Transformer-XL~\\citep{transformer-xl}, the Sandwich~\\citep{sandwich}, and Shortformer~\\citep{shortformer} models. Our results are similar to the ones obtained with staged training~\\citep{shortformer} but fall short of results obtained by Routing Transformer~\\citep{roy2020efficient} and kNN-LM~\\citep{khandelwal20generalization}. The methods used in those models are orthogonal to ours, and we hypothesize that combining them with ours might lead to even larger performance increases. \n\nAfter developing our method on WikiText-103, in Appendix Section~\\ref{subsec:tbc}, we run one set of experiments on a  different domain (books) using a similar model architecture and without modifying any of the \\al hyperparameters (the slopes) and show that our results fully transfer to this new domain. Our models are able to both surpass the sinusoidal baseline when not extrapolating while also outperforming it when extrapolating to longer sequences. \n\n\\subsection{Results on the CC100+RoBERTa Corpus}\n\nOur final set of experiments investigates whether \\al transfers to a larger model trained with a larger computational budget on a larger dataset than the ones we previously used. We show that our method achieves strong results in this more challenging setting, obtaining similar performance to the sinusoidal baseline while using significantly less memory, since we train on shorter subsequences. \n\nThe dataset we choose is a combination of the datasets used to train the RoBERTa~\\citep{roberta} implementation of BERT~\\citep{bert} and the English part of the CC-100 corpus introduced in~\\cite{cc-100}, for a total of 461 GB. The RoBERTa training corpus---i.e., the Toronto Book Corpus~\\citep{zhu2015aligning}, English Wikipedia, CC-News~\\citep{ccnews}, OpenWebText~\\citep{openwebtext} and Stories~\\citep{stories})---is 161 gigabytes, and the English part of the CC-100 corpus is 300 gigabytes. \nThe validation set contains 649K tokens.\n\n \n\nOur models for this dataset have 25 transformer layers with 16 heads and a dimension of 2048, with an 8192 hidden dimension of the feedforward sublayers.\nThese models have 1.3B parameters. \nWe train our models for one epoch, which is 50k updates on 128 V100 GPUs.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}{.45\\textwidth} %\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/ccr-train-512.pdf}\n \n\\end{subfigure}%\n\\begin{subfigure}{.45\\textwidth} %\n  \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/ccr-train-1k.pdf}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{ On the left (right), a 1.3B-parameter ALiBi model trained on 512 (1024) and evaluated on 1024 (2048) tokens during training, compared to the sinusoidal baseline trained on 1024 (2048) tokens.

Appendix Table \\ref{tab:ccr} shows memory use and end-of-training perplexities.}\n\\label{fig:ccr_train_all}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:ccr_train_all} (left), we compare the validation perplexity for \\li = 1024 throughout the training process for an \\al model trained with \\lt = 512 compared to the sinusoidal model trained with \\lt = 1024. Since our model is trained on shorter sequences, it is 7\\% faster and uses 1.6 GB less memory. We halt training of the sinusoidal baseline when our model reaches the end of its training (one epoch). \nAt that time, our model is just 0.06 perplexity away from the baseline even though it was trained on sequences that are half the length of those the baseline used and requires less memory.\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:ccr_train_all} (right), results become even more impressive, showing that our model trained on \\lt = 1024 outperforms by 0.09 perplexity the sinusoidal model trained on \\lt = 2048 (when evaluating with \\li = 2048) even though our model uses 3.1 GB less memory. Our model maintains a lead in perplexity over the sinusoidal model during the entire training process. By sampling five evenly distributed points across the training process, we compute that our \\lt = 1024 model reaches a given perplexity value, on average, 11\\% faster than the sinusoidal model does. \n\nSince our models in these comparisons use much less memory, they allow for stacking more layers, which would further improve performance (with negligible, if any, runtime cost). To keep our experiments as straightforward as possible, however, we do not add layers to our models.\n\nAppendix Table~\\ref{tab:ccr_all_50k} presents additional results comparing our models to the sinusoidal baseline when both are trained on the same $L$, showing that \\al performs similarly to the sinusoidal baseline when not extrapolating. This contrasts with the  results presented on the smaller datasets, where \\al consistently outperforms other position methods even when not extrapolating, suggesting that ALiBi's inductive bias provides additional benefits for lower-resource language modeling.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}{.45\\textwidth}  %\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/ccr_extra_512.pdf}\n\\end{subfigure}%\n\\begin{subfigure}{.45\\textwidth} %\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/ccr_extra_1024.pdf}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{The ALiBi and sinusoidal models (with both $L$ = 512 and 1024) trained for 50k updates (1 epoch) on the CC100+RoBERTa corpus, extrapolating on the validation set. %\n\\al achieves the best results at around $2L$ but maintains strong performance even up to 10000 tokens in these experiments.}\n\\label{fig:ccr_extra}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:ccr_extra} shows that our models trained on $L=512$ and $L=1024$ achieve the best results when extrapolating to about double the tokens that they were trained on.\nSpecifically, the \\lt = 512 model (that obtains 9.79 perplexity when \\li = 512) achieves its best score (9.3) when extrapolating to 1012 tokens, and the \\lt = 1024 model (that obtains 9.16 perplexity when \\li = 1024) achieves its best score (8.9) when extrapolating to 2024 tokens. \n\nOne possible explanation is that the subsequences the model observes during training are up to $L$ tokens long. When performing inference on subsequences of length $2L$, half of the subsequences the model consumes are as long as the examples seen during training. When inference is performed on subsequences of length $2L+1$ or longer, less than half of the predictions the model makes are on subsequences of lengths seen during training, and that might degrade performance. \n\nThe sinusoidal model cannot extrapolate at all in this setting, with its performance degrading for both the \\lt = 512 and 1024 models as soon as one token more than $L$ is added during evaluation. \n\nIn Appendix \\ref{sec:analysis}, we find that \\al's  edge over sinusoidal embeddings is largely explained by its improved avoidance of the early token curse.  We posit  that future work building on \\al might achieve further gains by more efficiently  exploiting longer histories.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\nIn parallel with our work,~\\citet{wennberg2021case} introduce a relative position method that, like our method, adds a bias to attention scores that is a function of the distance between the key and query elements. \nUnlike our \\al method, which uses a  non-learned linear function, their method uses a radial-basis function, with multiple trainable parameters (in our experiments, this led to a slight decrease in runtime). \nIn addition, they present experiments on text classification, not on language modeling.  They do not explore extrapolation.\nThe Distance Aware Transformer~\\citep{da-transformer} multiplies attention scores by a bias that is a function of the distance between the key and query. This function uses a different, learned parameter in every head. They show results only on text classification. In our experiments (not presented), multiplying attention scores by the bias (instead of adding, as in \\al) degraded performance. \n\nTransformer-XL~\\citep{transformer-xl}  presented a language model that uses a cache and can attend to more tokens during inference than it was trained on (by increasing the length of the cache). However, this work presents results only where output length is limited to the $L$ (the training length), and their relative position method is very slow~\\citep{shortformer}. \nThe Longformer~\\citep{longformer} adapts models trained on shorter sequences to document-level tasks. However, to achieve this they had to partially train their models on longer sequences. Our \\al method enables extrapolation without any additional training on longer sequences. \n\nTo our knowledge, extrapolation has not been previously explored in transformer language modeling, but it has been investigated previously and concurrently with transformers on other tasks, such as %\nmachine translation~\\citep{rosendahl2019:pos_enc, neishi-yoshinaga-2019-relation, newman2020extrapolation, Kiyono2021SHAPESA}, sequence-to-sequence models trained on an artificial dataset~\\citep{Hupkes2020}, pretrained sequence-to-sequence models tested on arithmetic tasks~\\citep[Appendix C]{Nogueira2021InvestigatingTL}, models trained with reinforcement learning~\\citep{lampinen2021towards}, image, speech recognition, and machine translation models~\\citep{likhomanenko2021cape}, and protein structure prediction~\\citep[Appendix 1.5]{Jumper2021HighlyAP}. \n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe showed that the sinusoidal position embedding approach does not enable transformers to extrapolate to inputs longer than the ones they were trained on. We then established that extrapolation in transformers can be enabled by just changing the position method.\nWe showed that our \\al method offers an extremely simple replacement for existing position approaches and allow models to extrapolate. In addition, when not extrapolating, our method achieves either better perplexity than the sinusoidal method (in models smaller than 1B parameters, trained on less data) or similar perplexity (in larger, billion parameter models trained on much more data). \n\\al is simple to implement and does not slow down runtime or require extra parameters (but does occasionally require a negligible amount of extra memory).\nUsing our method, we sped up the training of a 1.3 billion parameter model evaluated on the same input sequence length as GPT-3 (2048). \n\n\\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}\nWe thank Tim Dettmers, Gabriel Ilharco, Jungo Kasai, Hao Peng, Sewon Min, Sofia Serrano, Sam Shleifer, Luke Zettlemoyer, Julian Michael, Nikolaos Pappas, Yizhong Wang, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback and fruitful discussions.\n\\clearpage\n\n\\clearpage\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 1>\n\n<paper 2>\n\\title{KERPLE: Kernelized Relative Positional Embedding for Length Extrapolation}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{NoHyper}\n\\def\\thefootnote{$^*$}\\footnotetext{Equal contribution}\n\\end{NoHyper}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nRelative positional embeddings (RPE) have received considerable attention since RPEs effectively model the relative distance among tokens and enable length extrapolation. We propose KERPLE, a framework that generalizes relative position embedding for extrapolation by kernelizing positional differences. We achieve this goal using conditionally positive definite (CPD) kernels, a class of functions known for generalizing distance metrics. To maintain the inner product interpretation of self-attention, we show that a CPD kernel can be transformed into a PD kernel by adding a constant offset. This offset is implicitly absorbed in the Softmax normalization during self-attention. The diversity of CPD kernels allows us to derive various RPEs that enable length extrapolation in a principled way. Experiments demonstrate that the logarithmic variant achieves excellent extrapolation performance on three large language modeling datasets. Our implementation and pretrained checkpoints are released at~\\url{https://github.com/chijames/KERPLE.git}.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nTransformer-based models have excelled in various natural language processing tasks such as chatbot~\\citep{roller2021recipes}, code completion~\\citep{chen2021codex}, and paper abstract summarization~\\citep{zhang2020pegasus}.\nThese sequence modeling tasks often require the model to operate well on significantly longer text sequences than the fixed maximum length $L$ used at training time. Training (or retraining) the model using a substantially larger value of $L$ is often infeasible since the transformer training cost is $O(L^2)$. Hence, one desires a transformer that continues to perform well on longer sequences than those used during training; i.e., perform length extrapolation at inference time. Most transformer designs do not have this property \\citep{press2022train}. While recent work on absolute positional embeddings demonstrated the extrapolation ability \\citep{kiyono2021shiftedAbs,Likhomanenko2021CAPE}, it is believed that relative positional embeddings are more robust to input length change \\citep{Likhomanenko2021CAPE}, for example, ALiBi \\citep{press2022train} and T5 \\citep{raffel2019exploring}. Hence, we are motivated to study the inner workings of relative positional embeddings.\n\nRelative positional embeddings (RPE) encode the idea of shift-invariance: for any shift $p$, $(m+p)-(n+p)=m-n$. It is often added directly to the self-attention matrix before Softmax normalization \\citep{chen2021simple}. Inspired by shift-invariance and the ability of a kernel to define a similarity function, there have been studies on shift-invariant kernels for RPE~\\citep{wennberg2021case} with a focus on Gaussian kernel. However, in our preliminary experiments, the Gaussian kernel demonstrates limited length extrapolation ability (see Appendix~\\ref{appendix:experi_gauss}). Hence, a distinct class of shift-invariant kernels is needed to achieve adequate length extrapolation.\n\nTo this end, we note a set of well-established conditionally positive definite (CPD) kernels suitable for modeling distance metrics~\\citep{Schplkopf2000cpd}. However, CPD kernels do not conform to an inner product. We can remedy this issue by transforming a CPD kernel into a PD kernel by adding a sufficiently large constant. This constant offset is subsequently absorbed implicitly in the Softmax normalization (see the discussion below Eq.~\\eqref{eq:krpe-deriv}).\nFor example, ALiBi implicitly admits a PD kernel of the form $c-|m-n|$ (see the end of section~\\ref{sec:krpe}), which is reduced to a CPD kernel $-|m-n|$. The CPD kernel and Softmax normalization combination opens the door to a sea of possible CPD kernels. We investigate structures from this class that exhibit a strong length extrapolation ability, like ALiBi.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\caption{\\textbf{The 3-Para-Log Variant of Our KERPLE Framework.} $a$, $b$, and $p$ are learnable parameters in each attention head shared across layers. Since \\# of heads is $H$, there are $3\\cdot H$ learnable parameters. The learnable parameters are trained with length-3 sequences. At the inference time, the last row (in dashed squares) becomes active, and the model extrapolates to length-4 sequences. Note we focus on causal language modeling following ALiBi, so the matrices are triangular.}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.6\\textwidth]{kerple_arch.pdf}\n\\label{fig:illustration}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nOur main result is a framework for \\textbf{KE}rnelize \\textbf{R}elative \\textbf{P}ositional Embedding for \\textbf{L}ength \\textbf{E}xtrapolation (\\textbf{KERPLE}). The framework elucidates key principles that encourage the length extrapolation property. We show that ALiBi is a particular instance within our framework. Our subsequent experiments suggest that the proposed method yields better length extrapolation on large datasets such as OpenWebText2, GitHub, and ArXiv.\n\n\\section{Background and Related Work}\n\\subsection{Preliminary}\nLet $\\{w_m\\}_{m=1}^L$ be the input tokens to a transformer model, where $L$ is the total number of tokens. Each $w_m$ is a scalar and is used to index the embedding vector $\\bm e_m \\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ as the input to the transformer. A transformer converts each $\\bm e_m$ into query, key, and value vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^d$: $\\bm q_m=\\bm W_q\\bm e_m$, $\\bm k_m=\\bm W_k \\bm e_m$, $\\bm v_m=\\bm W_v \\bm e_m$, where $\\bm W_q$, $\\bm W_k$, $\\bm W_v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}$ are learnable matrices. Then, the self-attention module computes the scaled attention scores and generates the output vector $\\bm o_m$ at position $m$ as: $$a_{m,n}=\\frac{\\exp(\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n/\\sqrt{d})}{\\sum_{i=1}^L \\exp(\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_i/\\sqrt{d})},\\quad \\bm o_m = \\sum_{n=1}^L a_{m,n}\\bm v_n.$$\nSince the operation is position-agnostic, it is believed that positional information helps model token interactions \\citep{vaswani2017attention}, which we survey in the next subsection.\n\n\\subsection{Positional Embedding}\n\\paragraph{Absolute.} Absolute positional embeddings assign a positional vector $\\bm p_m$ to each position $m$ and adds $\\bm p_m$ to the embedding vector $\\bm e_m$. The very first version of which is the predefined sinusoidal function~\\citep{vaswani2017attention}. Followed by the success of BERT~\\citep{devlin2018bert}, learnable absolute positional embeddings have been applied to the task of masked language modeling~\\citep{devlin2018bert,liu2019roberta,Clark2020ELECTRA,Lan2020albert}, Autoregressive-decoding \\citep{radford2018improving,radford2019language}, and sequence-to-sequence~\\citep{Gehring2017seq2seq,lewis2019bart} settings. Recent work studied ways to extrapolate sinusoidal positional embeddings to longer sequences by randomly shifting absolute positions during training \\citep{kiyono2021shiftedAbs} or augmenting with continuous signals \\citep{Likhomanenko2021CAPE}.\n\n\\paragraph{Relative.} As opposed to the modeling of absolute position $m$, relative positional embeddings (RPE) that model the positional difference $m-n$ has become popular in the literature~\\citep{shaw2018rpe,huang2018music,dai2019transformer,yang2019xlnet,huang2020rpe,he2021deberta,ke2021rethinking,chen2021simple}. In particular, the T5 model that considers bucketed relative distances and log-binning has been shown to perform well on various transformer architectures~\\citep{raffel2019exploring}. Rotary positional embedding \\citep{su2021roformer} encodes the position with rotations: $f(\\bm q_m,m)=R_m\\bm q_m$ where $R_m$ is a rotation matrix with angles proportional to $m$. With the rotation's property, the query-key product exhibits a positional difference: $f(\\bm q_m,m)^\\top f(\\bm k_n,n)=\\bm q_m^\\top R_{n-m}\\bm k_n$.\n\nWe note that the overview above focuses on the NLP domain. Recent work has applied positional embeddings to other domains such as vision \\citep{Kan2021vision} and speech \\citep{Likhomanenko2021CAPE}. A survey can be found in \\citep{Dufter2022posOverview}. \n\n\\subsection{Kernel and its Application in Transformer}\nThe kernel trick is a classic approach to generalize the inner product to high dimensional spaces \\citep{mika1998kernelsvd,Schplkopf2000cpd,leslie2001kernelsvm,dhillon2004kernelkmeans,takeda2007kernelregress}. In the context of transformers, there has been interest in applying kernels to the self-attention structure to enhance the performance. Examples of such work include kernel for positional embeddings \\citep{tsai2019transformer,wu2020transformer,wennberg2021case,luo2021stable}. Another line of research leverages the kernel's feature map \\citep{Rahimi2007rndfeature} to linearize the self-attention module and reduce the computational cost \\citep{katharopoulos20a,chen2021skyformer,xiong2021nystromformer,peng2021random,choromanski2021performers,qin2022cosformer}. %Although our work does not focus on linearization, we note that a potential benefit of the kernel formulation is to enable linearization.\n\n\\section{Theoretical Foundations of CPD Kernels}\n\\label{sec:cpd}\n\\subsection{PD and CPD Kernels}\nIn this work, we use shift-invariant conditionally positive definite (CPD) kernels to model the effect of relative positional differences. We propose this formulation because the notion of \\emph{relative} is modeled by a shift-invariant function: a bivariate function $k$ over two positions $(m,n)$ such that $k(m,n)=f(m-n)$ for some univariate $f$. The notion of~\\emph{positional difference} $m-n$ is generalized by the CPD kernel. We review the definitions of PD and CPD kernels below.\n\n\\begin{definition}[PD Kernel]\nA (real) symmetric function $k:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a positive definite kernel if for any integer $N$ and any $\\{x_i\\in\\mathcal{X}\\}_{i=1}^N$,  $\\{c_i\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}_{i=1}^N$, the quadratic form is nonnegative: $\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=1}^Nc_ic_jk(x_i,x_j)\\geq 0$.\n\\label{def:kernel}\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[CPD Kernel]\nA (real) symmetric function $\\tilde{k}:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a conditionally positive definite kernel if for any integer $N$ and any $\\{x_i\\in\\mathcal{X}\\}_{i=1}^N$, the quadratic form is conditionally nonnegative: $\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=1}^Nc_ic_j\\tilde{k}(x_i,x_j)\\geq 0$ for $\\{c_i\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}_{i=1}^N$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^N c_i=0.$\n\\label{def:cpd_kernel}\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{fact}[\\citet{berg1984harmonic} and Prop. 5 of \\citet{Schplkopf2000cpd}]\n    Let $\\tilde{k}:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow (-\\infty,0]$ be a CPD kernel with $\\tilde{k}(x,x)=0~\\forall x\\in \\mathcal{X}$. Then, there exists a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ and a mapping $\\phi:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{H}$ such that $\\norm{\\phi(x)-\\phi(x')}^2=-\\tilde{k}(x,x')$.\n    \\label{fact:cpd_metric}\n\\end{fact}\nFact~\\ref{fact:cpd_metric} suggests that CPD kernels generalize distance metrics to high dimensional spaces. Since we are interested in positional differences, we examine modeling the distance between positions using CPD kernels.\n\nHowever, Fact~\\ref{fact:cpd_metric} also implies that CPD kernels do not encode inner products as required by self-attention for the computation of pairwise relations. PD kernels represent inner products. To better understand the effect of CPD kernels on self-attention, we need to establish relations between CPD and PD kernels. As noted in \\citet{Schplkopf2000cpd}, if one takes any PD kernel and offsets it by a constant, the result is at least a CPD kernel. In the next subsection, we show that the converse is~\\emph{nearly} true: if $\\tilde{k}$ is CPD, so is $c+\\tilde{k}$ for large enough $c\\in\\mathbb{R}$ (Lemma~\\ref{lemma:cpd_shift}). Therefore, we may generate the CPD kernels of interest and transform them into PD kernels if needed.\n\n\\subsection{Constructing PD Kernels From CPD Kernels via Constant Shifts}\n\nIn this subsection, we review a few properties of CPD kernels and use these to generate a variety of CPD kernels. Then, we present a lemma that transforms CPD kernels into PD kernels via constant shifts. This enables the production of a family of PD kernels from CPD kernels. Finally, we present our critical observation that the exact value of the constant shift is not needed, thanks to a nice property of Softmax normalization.\n\nBelow are some important facts about CPD kernels.\n\\begin{fact}[Scaling and Summation]\n    If $\\tilde{k}_1$ and $\\tilde{k}_2$ are CPD, then so are $a\\cdot \\tilde{k}_1$ (for $a>0$) and $\\tilde{k}_1+\\tilde{k}_2$.\n    \\label{fact:cpd_prop_basic}\n\\end{fact}\n\\begin{fact}[\\citet{berg1984harmonic} and Prop. 4 of \\citet{Schplkopf2000cpd}]\n    If $\\tilde{k}:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow (-\\infty,0]$ is CPD, then so are $-(-\\tilde{k})^\\alpha$ for $0<\\alpha<1$ and $-\\log(1-\\tilde{k})$.\n    \\label{fact:cpt_prop}\n\\end{fact}\n\\begin{fact}[Page 3 of \\citet{Schplkopf2000cpd}]\n    The negative squared distance $-\\norm{x-x'}^2$ is CPD.\n    \\label{fact:negdis_prop}\n\\end{fact}\n\nThe three Facts above jointly yield a rich family of CPD kernels as shown below.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\n    The following are CPD kernels.\n    \\begin{enumerate}[topsep=-3pt, itemsep=-3pt,label=(\\alph*)]\n        \\item $\\tilde{k}(x,x')=-a\\norm{x-x'}^p$ with $0<p\\leq 2$ and $a>0$.\n        \\item $\\tilde{k}(x,x')=-b\\cdot \\log(1+a\\norm{x-x'}^p)$ with $0<p\\leq 2$ and $a,b>0$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \\label{cor:cpd_examples}\n\\end{corollary}\nWe note that it is possible to keep iterating between Fact~\\ref{fact:cpd_prop_basic} and \\ref{fact:cpt_prop} and generate more complicated examples, e.g., $-a\\norm{x-x'}^p-b\\cdot \\log(1+a\\norm{x-x'}^p)$ or $-b\\cdot \\log(1+a\\norm{x-x'}^p)^c$ for $0<c<1$. However, since relative positional embeddings are of our interest, we only consider simple CPD kernels. Those with complicated forms are deferred to future work.\n\nNow that Corollary~\\ref{cor:cpd_examples} has presented a few class of CPD kernels, we prove a lemma (in Appendix~\\ref{appendix:cpd_shift_proof}) that constructs PD kernels from CPD kernels through shifting. Later in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:krpe-deriv}, we will see that the shifting construction is combined neatly with the Softmax normalization of self-attention.\n\\begin{lemma}[CPD Shift Lemma. Proof in Appendix~\\ref{appendix:cpd_shift_proof}]\n\tLet $\\tilde{k}:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ be a CPD kernel. There exists $c\\geq 0$ such that $c+\\tilde{k}$ is a PD kernel.\n\t\\label{lemma:cpd_shift}\n\\end{lemma}\nLemma~\\ref{lemma:cpd_shift} implies the CPD kernels in Corollary~\\ref{cor:cpd_examples} can be made PD if a large enough constant is added. For example, $c-\\norm{x-x'}^p$ for large enough $c$. Although Lemma~\\ref{lemma:cpd_shift} does not have an explicit construction of $c$, thanks to the shift-invariant property of the Softmax normalization, we can leave it as an under-determined constant in our positional embedding design (Eq.~\\eqref{eq:krpe} in section~\\ref{sec:krpe}). Given a set of test points $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^N$, one can do a geometric sequence search\\footnote{By geometric sequence search, we can enlarge $c$ by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on until we find the required large enough constant.} to search for a $c$ such that the $N\\times N$ matrix $[c+\\tilde{k}(x_i,x_j)]_{i,j=1}^N\\succeq 0$. Hence, we do not need the value of $c$ , but we can compute it if needed, e.g., deriving the feature map of $c+\\tilde{k}$.\n\n\\paragraph{Alternative Proof of $\\pmb{c-\\norm{x-x'}^p}$.} While the CPD shift lemma is convenient, one can prove $c-\\norm{x-x'}^p$ is PD for large enough $c$ using a kernel representation theorem in \\citet{schoenberg1938metric}. See Appendix~\\ref{appendix:alternative} for details.\n\n\\section{Kernelized Relative Positional Embedding}\n\\label{sec:krpe}\nLet $\\{\\bm q_m\\}_{m=1}^L$ and $\\{\\bm k_n\\}_{n=1}^L$ be the input queries and keys. Let $(r_1,...,r_\\ell)$ be learnable parameters. We propose a kernelized relative positional embedding as follows.\n\\begin{equation}\n    a_{m,n}=\\frac{\\exp\\big((\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n  +\\tilde{k}_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}(m,n))/\\sqrt{d}\\big)}{\\sum_{i=1}^L \\exp((\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_i+\\tilde{k}_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}(m,i))/\\sqrt{d})},\n    \\label{eq:krpe}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\tilde{k}_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}(m,n)$ is any shift-invariant CPD kernel with $\\ell$ parameters. Due to Lemma~\\ref{lemma:cpd_shift}, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:krpe} can be reformulated into its kernel form as follows.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n    a_{m,n}\\overset{(*)}{=}&\\frac{\\exp\\big((\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n  +c+\\tilde{k}_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}(m,n))/\\sqrt{d}\\big)}{\\sum_{i=1}^L \\exp((\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_i+c+\\tilde{k}_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}(m,i))/\\sqrt{d})}\\\\\n    \\overset{\\text{Lemma}~\\ref{lemma:cpd_shift}}{=}&\\frac{\\exp\\big(\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n+k_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}(m,n))/\\sqrt{d}\\big)}{\\sum_{i=1}^L \\exp(\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_i +k_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}(m,i))/\\sqrt{d})}=\\frac{\\exp\\big(k^{\\text{comp}}([\\bm q_m,m],[\\bm k_n,n])/\\sqrt{d}\\big)}{\\sum_{i=1}^L \\exp\\big(k^{\\text{comp}}([\\bm q_m,m],[\\bm k_i,i])/\\sqrt{d}\\big)}.\n\\end{split}\n\\label{eq:krpe-deriv}\n\\end{equation}\n\n(*) is due to the shift-invariant property of the Softmax normalization: $\\frac{\\exp(x_i)}{\\sum_j \\exp(x_j)}=\\frac{\\exp(x_i+c)}{\\sum_j \\exp(x_j+c)}$ for any $c\\in \\mathbb{R}$. The second equality defines a~\\emph{bias kernel} which is positive definite using Lemma~\\ref{lemma:cpd_shift}:\n\\begin{equation}\n    k_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}= c+\\tilde{k}_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}.\n    \\label{eq:bias_kernel}\n\\end{equation}\nThe last equality introduces a~\\emph{composite kernel} $k^{\\text{comp}}:\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\\times \\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ as\n\\begin{equation}\n    k^{\\text{comp}}([\\bm q_m,m],[\\bm k_n,n])= \\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n + k_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}(m,n).\n    \\label{eq:comp_ker}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\paragraph{Interpretation.} The proposed method can be interpreted as applying a composite kernel to self-attention. The composite kernel combines the information from query $\\bm q_m$, key $\\bm k_n$, and positions $(m,n)$ in a way that augments the original self-attention structure by multiplicative and additive position embeddings. The augmentation allows $k^{\\text{comp}}$ to not only retain the original $\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n$ but also include positional information from the bias kernel $k_{r_1,...,r_\\ell}$.\n\n\\paragraph{Practical Choice.} In section~\\ref{sec:experi_results}, we fix $\\ell=2$ and experiment on two variants of the composite kernel, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:comp_ker}, where we call these the~\\emph{power} variant and  the~\\emph{logarithmic} variant of our proposed KERPLE framework, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:krpe-deriv}. These are from a combination of Corollary~\\ref{cor:cpd_examples} and Eq.~\\eqref{eq:bias_kernel}.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[topsep=-3pt, itemsep=-1pt,label=(\\alph*),leftmargin=22mm]\n    \\item[(power)] $k^{\\text{comp}}([\\bm q_m,m],[\\bm k_n,n])= \\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n +c-r_1|m-n|^{r_2}$ with $r_1>0$ and $0<r_2\\leq 2$.\n    \\item[(logarithmic)] $k^{\\text{comp}}([\\bm q_m,m],[\\bm k_n,n])= \\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n +c-r_1\\cdot \\log(1+r_2|m-n|)$ with $r_1,r_2>0$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nWe note that these are not the only variants of the composite kernel. In section~\\ref{sec:ablation}, we experiment with two more complicated variants, but only find lower training speeds and marginal improvement in perplexities (e.g., logarithmic variant vs. 3-para-log). Thus, based on our study, the choices above hold advantages in both performance and speed. \n\n\\paragraph{Connection to Prior Work.} When the bias kernel, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:bias_kernel}, is a triangle kernel: $c-|m-n|$, our model reduces to ALiBi \\citep{press2022train}. \\citet{wennberg2021case} discuss the situation where the bias kernel is a Gaussian kernel. \\citet{tsai2019transformer} is the case where there is no bias kernel and the attention product $\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n$ is multiplied by an exponentiated inner product kernel, $\\exp(\\bm x^\\top \\bm y)$. Since ALiBi is the state-of-the-art and has great input length extrapolation, we will focus on comparison with ALiBi in our experiments.\n\nThe logarithmic variant has an implicit connection to T5 positional bias \\citep{raffel2019exploring}. According to the official GitHub repository \\url{https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer} and the HuggingFace Transformer \\citep{wolf2020huggingface}, T5 bias is implemented with a log-binning strategy. For each head of the transformer, they maintain a bucket of 32 learnable parameters and assign the relative positional bias $b_{m-n}$ to these parameters as\n$$\nb_{m-n}=\\begin{cases}\n\\text{bucket}[0] & \\text{if~}m-n< 0\\\\\n\\text{bucket}[m-n] & \\text{if~}0\\leq m-n<16\\\\\n\\text{bucket}[\\min(31, \\lfloor \\frac{\\log((m-n)/16)}{\\log(128/16)})\\cdot 16\\rfloor] & \\text{if~}m-n\\geq 16,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $\\lfloor\\cdot\\rfloor$ is the floor function. Note that the log factor is approximately $7.7\\log\\frac{m-n}{16}$. Therefore, T5 is using a logarithmic bucket assignment, which turns out to extrapolate to different input lengths. Compared with T5, our logarithmic variant uses less parameters (2x12 vs. 32x12) but cannot learn non-monotonic relations (the log function is monotonic). We will conduct more comparisons with T5 bias in our experiments.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experi}\n\n\\subsection{Dataset and Implementation Description}\n\\paragraph{Dataset.} We conduct experiments on OpenWebText2, GitHub, and ArXiv datasets gathered in \\citet{gao2020pile}. OpenWebText2 includes recent content from Reddit submissions until 2020, content from multiple languages, document metadata, multiple dataset versions, and open-source replication code. GitHub includes open-source repositories written in primary coding languages such as Java, C/C++, Python, and Go. ArXiv includes papers written in LaTex in Math, Computer Science, Physics, and some related fields. These tasks are motivated by the downstream applications such as online chatting \\citep{roller2021recipes}, code completion \\citep{chen2021codex}, and academic paper summarization \\citep{zhang2020pegasus}.\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Dataset Overview.} Raw Size is the size before any up- or down-sampling.}\n    \\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n    \\hline\\hline\n    & OpenWebText2 & GitHub & ArXiv\\\\ \\hline\n    Raw Size & 66.77 GB & 95.16 GB & 56.21 GB\\\\\n    Type & Internet & Coding & Academic\\\\\n    \\hline\\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\label{tab:dataset}\n    \\vspace{-3mm}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\paragraph{Implementation.} We adapt our model from GPT-NeoX \\citep{gpt-neox}, a transformer implementation by the EleutherAI team.

We adopt almost all configurations of small GPT-NeoX\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/blob/main/configs/small\\_bf16.yml}}, except that we change the train-micro-batch-size to 32, seq-length to 512, and max-position-embeddings to 512.

Appendix~\\ref{appendix:more-experi} to~\\ref{sec:hyper_model})}\n\\label{sec:experi_results}\nWe conduct experiments to cover aspects such as input length extrapolation, application on different domains, and comparison with the prior work. These are elaborated on below. (i) Motivated by the input length extrapolation demonstrated in \\citep{press2022train}, we train our model with length 512 and test on lengths ranging from 512 to 16384. We hope that the emphasis on extrapolation enables the application of transformers to longer sequences. (ii) To evaluate the applicability of the model in different domains, we conduct experiments on OpenWebText2, GitHub, and ArXiv datasets. (iii) To validate the effectiveness of our method, we compare KERPLE with Sinusoidal \\citep{vaswani2017attention}, Rotary \\citep{su2021roformer}, T5 \\citep{raffel2019exploring}, and ALiBi \\citep{press2022train}.\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:openweb-github-arxiv} reports the perplexities at different extrapolation lengths. We perform non-overlapping evaluation: Suppose text is segmented in a different manner for 512 and 1024 tokens, we have N sentences and N/2 correspondingly to evaluate. We also perform a paired two-sided t-test to validate the statistical significance (significance level=0.05). We compare each candidate RPE with our proposed logarithmic variant and mark the candidate with a $^\\dagger$~\\emph{if the log variant is statistically significantly better}. Table~\\ref{tab:speed} reports the training speeds. These tables yield three conclusions. First, within the KERPLE framework, the logarithmic variant is better than the power variant. Secondly, the logarithmic variant is 9.7\\% faster than T5. In terms of extrapolation, the logarithmic variant generally does better than T5 but could be slightly worse than T5 at shorter lengths. Third, the logarithmic variant is slightly slower than some prior work (ALiBi, Rotary, and Sinusoidal) but consistently outperform these methods at all extrapolation lengths. More details are given below.\n\n\\paragraph{Logarithmic Variant vs. Power Variant.} In our proposed KERPLE framework, the logarithmic variant is better than the power variant. Precisely, the logarithmic variant is 4.4\\% faster and has lower perplexities across all extrapolation lengths and all tasks.\n\n\\paragraph{Logarithmic Variant vs. T5.} In terms of speed, the logarithmic variant is 9.7\\% faster than T5. In terms of extrapolation perplexity, the logarithmic variant is close to or slightly worse than T5 when the extrapolation length is shorter than 2048, and consistently excels T5 at longer extrapolation lengths. The tendency of extrapolation holds for all datasets evaluated in this work. \n\n\\paragraph{Logarithmic Variant vs. ALiBi, Rotary, and Sinusoidal.} The logarithmic variant is 1.6\\% slower, 7.5\\% faster, and 3.0\\% slower than ALiBi, Rotary, and Sinusoidal. The speed comparison makes sense because we require only a limited amount of learnable parameters for RPEs (at most $3\\cdot H$). Also, the logarithmic variant consistently outperforms prior work at all extrapolation lengths and tasks.\n\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n    \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{2pt}\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Perplexity Comparison on OpenWebText2, GitHub, and ArXiv.} All models are trained for 50k steps with training length 512 and five random seeds. $x^\\dagger$ means our log variant is statistically significantly~\\emph{better} than $x$.

logarithmic) in section~\\ref{sec:krpe}, we consider two complicated versions of the composite kernel, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:comp_ker}, as follows.\n\\begin{enumerate}[topsep=-3pt, itemsep=-1pt, leftmargin=20mm]\n    \\item[(bias+wht)] bias + weight:\\\\\n    $k^{\\text{comp}}([\\bm q_m,m],[\\bm k_n,n])= \\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n\\cdot \\exp(-r_3|m-n|^{r_4}) + c-r_1|m-n|^{r_2}$\\\\ \n    with $r_1,r_3>0$ and $0<r_2,r_4\\leq 2$.\n    \\item[(3-para-log)] 3-parameter-logarithmic:\\\\\n    $k^{\\text{comp}}([\\bm q_m,m],[\\bm k_n,n])= \\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n+c-r_1\\cdot \\log(1+r_2|m-n|^{r_3})$\\\\\n    with $r_1,r_2>0$ and $0<r_3\\leq 2$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nRecall the tensor product property of a kernel: if $k_1$ is a kernel on $\\mathcal{X}$ and $k_2$ is a kernel on $\\mathcal{Y}$, then $k((x,y),(x',y'))=k_1(x,x')k_2(y,y')$ is a kernel on $\\mathcal{X}\\times \\mathcal{Y}$. Therefore, (bias+wht) is the setting where we train a weight $\\exp(-r_3|m-n|^{r_4})$ and a bias kernel $c-r_1|m-n|^{r_2}$. $\\bm q_m^\\top \\bm k_n$ is multiplied by the weight kernel and then added with the bias kernel. (3-para-log) is the setting where we consider $|m-n|^{r_3}$ in the log. When $r_3=1$, it is reduced to the logarithmic variant proposed in section~\\ref{sec:krpe}.\n\nWe plug in these composite kernel $k^{\\text{comp}}$ into our KERPLE framework, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:krpe-deriv}, and test the performance of these RPE. Compared with section~\\ref{sec:experi_results}, Table~\\ref{tab:add_experi} suggests that these variants do not have clear advantage in extrapolation performance, e.g., 3-para-log is slightly better in perplexity than the (two-parameter) logarithmic variant. Thus, enlarging the complexity of kernels does not necessarily give better performance in the context of RPE.\n\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n    \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{4pt}\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Perplexity Comparison for KERPLE with Complicated Kernels on OpenWebText2, GitHub, and ArXiv.} All models are trained for 50k steps with training length 512 and five seeds random.

We use the GitHub dataset for demonstration. Please see Figure~\\ref{fig:log_rebuttal},~\\ref{fig:power_rebuttal}, and~\\ref{fig:alibi_rebuttal}. Both ALiBi and its generalized power variant quickly reach a very negative value. In contrast, the log variant successfully discovers several flat kernels, effectively extending the window attention. This corroborates our previous observation that KERPLE-log can utilize more distant token information.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Kernel Functions of Learned by the Log Variant.}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{log_rebuttal.png}\n\\label{fig:log_rebuttal}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Kernel Functions Learned by the Power Variant.

Please see Appendix~\\ref{sec:posppl_16384} for similar length=16384 result. The evaluation is done by measuring the loss at each position in each sequence and averaging over the sequences.\n\nWe note that PPL@512 of KERPLE-log is the lowest among all model variants. We can derive several critical observations for evaluation length=4096 in Figure~\\ref{fig:pos-wise-ppl-window-4096}: First, KERPLE-log lies below KERPLE-log-windowed@512, indicating its usage of more distant information than window attention: If our model does not use more information other than a fixed-window=512, the y-values after position=512 should overlap with the line windowed at 512. This is clearly not the case. In addition, the PPL of KERPLE-log continues to decrease till the end of 4096 positions (Not plateauing). Second, T5 lies below KERPLE-log-windowed@512 most of the time and fluctuates around KERPLE-log-windowed@512 after length=3000. It is still worse than KERPLE-log. Third, ALiBi lies above KERPLE-log-windowed@512 for almost all the positions, indicating that window attention might be a better choice than ALiBi.\n\nAlthough window attention is a strong baseline, our KERPLE-log is almost like a free lunch compared to window attention: With only 24 additional learnable parameters (2 para. for each head), the almost same training speed, and the same train length=512 as window attention, it is able to achieve lower PPLs across different positions.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n    \\centering   \n    \\caption{\\textbf{Position-wise Perplexity on GitHub at Evaluation Length=4096 Compared to Window Attention@512.}}\n    {{\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{pos_Perplexity_4096.pdf} }}%\n    \\label{fig:pos-wise-ppl-window-4096}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\nA general framework, KERPLE, is proposed to kernelize relative positional embeddings for length extrapolation. At the core of this framework is the application of CPD kernels and the derivation of practical variants. We show that these CPD kernels can be implicitly converted to PD kernels, which keep the inner product interpretation of self-attention. We also demonstrate that the logarithmic variant achieves exceptional extrapolation performance on three large language modeling datasets. We believe our work paves the way for some interesting future directions that resolve our limitations. For instance, we can consider general kernel families and model non-monotonic effects due to positional differences. In addition, the use of learnable parameters in KERPLE might enable better generalization to inputs higher than one-dimensional. Last but not least, there is always room for improving memory efficiency by adjusting the model architecture and training procedure.\n\n\\section{Broader Impact}\n\\label{sec:broader_impact}\nOur work develops a better understanding of relative positional embedding for transformers based on expressive kernel classes that adapt well to various datasets. The results apply to domains where the positional information is helpful in the modeling, e.g., natural language, programming language, and DNA/protein sequences for biology/medicine. The studies of transformers may have positive economic effects by enabling new tasks which cannot be done by humans or enhancing accuracy and efficiency. But inappropriate use can have negative societal impacts. These include job loss due to automation, the ethical challenges from improper text generation, and the privacy issues in the data collection process. These implications apply to any research on natural language processing and are not associated with any specific work.\n\n\\section{Acknowledgement}\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful feedback and suggestions.

However this requires training the model further on longer sequence length data, albeit for much fewer steps than original training. Further PI also results in slight degradation of performance.\n\n\\section{Attention for Long sequence lengths}\nLet $a_{12}$ denote attention between tokens $1$ and $2$ and let attention with rest of the tokens be some padding value $a_p$. With increasing sequence length attained by adding padding tokens, attention $a_{12}$ decays as follows.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    p_{12} = \\frac{e^{a_{12}}}{e^{a_{12}} + e^{a_{21}} + (n-2)*e^{a_{p}}}\n\\end{align*}\nThis shows that attention decays as $1/n$ with sequence length $n$.\n\nOne way to prevent this is by imposing a $top_k$ on attention logits before softmax.\n\n\\section{RPE variants}\n\\subsection{MLP RPE}\nWe can use an MLP $f: \\R\\to \\R^{N_H}$ to map relative distance to each heads. In particular, we use a 2/3-layer MLP with the activation function $\\sigma$:\\footnote{Bias terms of the linear mappings are omitted for brevity.}\n\\begin{equation*}\n    f(x)=\\mW_3\\sigma(\\mW_2 \\sigma(\\vw_1 x))\\text{ (three layer), or }f(x)=\\mW_3\\sigma(\\vw_1 x)\\text{ (two layer)},\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\mW_3\\in\\R^{N_H\\times d}$, $\\mW_2\\in\\R^{d\\times d}$, $\\vw_1\\in\\R^{d}$. The activation function $\\sigma$ is $\\mathrm{ReLU}$. The width $d$ is set to 32 unless specified otherwise.\n\nFor attention from $i$-th token to $j$-th token, there are two choices for the input to MLPs:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Normalized relative distance.} Feed $\\frac{i-j}{i+1}$ as the input. Here the position is normalized by the length of current sequence, resulting in an input in $[0,1)$. This makes the input to MLP always fall in a fixed bounded domain, and can potentially generalize to unseen relative distance. \n    \\item \\textbf{Normalized relative distance with $\\log$ transform.} Feed $\\frac{\\log(c|i-j|+1)}{\\log(ci+1)+1}$ as the input ($c$ is some hyper-parameter). The normalization again forces the input to be in $[0,1)$. The $\\log$ transform is based on the intuition that nearby tokens require finer positional information, while exact distance for distant tokens are less important.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\cy{Several thoughts:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The function seems homogeneous (ie $f(kx) = kf(x)$) which may be problematic: the PE scales linearly with the distance $j - i$. Maybe sigmoid activation and/or adding bias term may fix it.\n    \\item With the normalization $i+1$ the absolute distance information is missing. Maybe feed both $j-i$ and $i+1$ as two separate inputs to the network.\n    \\item Instead of MLP, can also think of some ``whitebox'' architectures such as fitting a piecewise linear function (something like go/bidirectional-learnable-transform). Though this may only reduce computation but does not solve length generalization.\n    \\item Once learned, we may read out the parameters from ckpt and plot $f$, to get a sense of what we've learned.\n\\end{itemize}\n}\n\nSpecifically, for attention from $i$-th token to $j$-th token, the MLP takes $\\frac{j-i}{i+1}$ as the input. This will enforce the input to be in $[-1, 0)$, potentially lead to training stability and generalization ability.\n\n\\subsection{Kronecker RPE}\nWe can use Kronecker product to construct the $n \\times n$ PE matrix. \n\nGiven $\\mS\\in\\R^{n_1\\times n_1}$ and $\\mT\\in\\R^{n_2\\times n_2}$ such that $n_1n_2=n$, we use $\\mR = \\mS\\otimes \\mT$ as the RPE matrix.\n\n\\section{Existing length extrapolation RPE}\nDenote by $a_{ij}$ the $(i, j)$-th entry of the (unnormalized) attention matrix.\n\nALiBi: $\\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter that is set a piror for each head.\n\\begin{equation*}\n    a_{ij} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\vq_i\\vk_j^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}-\\lambda |i-j|\\right).\n\\end{equation*}\n\nKERPLE: $r_1$ and $r_2$ are trainable parameters.\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\text{(Power variant)} & \\quad a_{ij} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\vq_i\\vk_j^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}-r_1 |i-j|^{r_2}\\right). \\\\ \n    \\text{(Logarithmic variant)} & \\quad a_{ij} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\vq_i\\vk_j^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}-r_1 \\log(1+r_2|i-j|)\\right). \n\\end{align*}\n\nSandwich: $\\vp_i$ denotes the sinusoidal positional encoding, i.e.\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\vp_i = \\begin{bmatrix}\n        \\sin \\frac{i}{10000^{2/d}}& \\cos \\frac{i}{10000^{2/d}} &\\sin \\frac{i}{10000^{4/d}}& \\cos \\frac{i}{10000^{4/d}} & \\cdots & \\cos \\frac{i}{10000^{1}}\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThe attention is calculated as\n\\begin{equation*}\n    a_{ij} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\vq_i\\vk_j^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}+\\lambda\\vp_i \\vp_j^{\\top}\\right).\n\\end{equation*}\n\nLimitations: ignore distant tokens.\n\nIf we assume that $c<\\vq_i\\vk_j^{\\top}<C$ for any $1\\leq j\\leq i$, and denote the RPE bias by $r_{i-j}$, then\n\\begin{align*}\n    p_{ik} \\sim \\frac{\\exp(a_{ik})}{\\sum_{j=1}^i \\exp(r_{i-j})}\n\\end{align*}\nToken $i$ would be unable to attend to anything if $i$ is large and \n$$\n    \\lim_{i\\to +\\infty} \\sum_{j=1}^i \\exp(r_{i-j})=+\\infty.\n$$\n\n\\section{A Mathematical Formulation of Length Generalization Problem}\n\nGiven a set of keys $\\{\\vk_i\\}_{i=1}^T$ and values $\\{\\vv_i\\}_{i=1}^T$ of sequence length $T$, recall that self-attention for a query $\\vq$  computes the following\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\vv = \\sum_{i = 1}^T\\frac{\\exp(\\langle \\vq, \\vk_i \\rangle + p_i) \\cdot \\vv_i}{ \\sum_{j=1}^T \\exp(\\langle \\vq, \\vk_j \\rangle + p_j)},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\{p_i\\}_{i=1}^T$ is an additive position embedding.\n\nTo formulate the problem of length generalization, let us assume that $\\{\\vk_i\\}_{i=1}^T$ and $\\{\\vv_i\\}_{i=1}^T$ are drawn i.i.d. from two distributions $P_{\\vk}$ and $P_{\\vv}$, respectively. (To start with, we may simply assume $P_{\\vk}$ and $P_{\\vv}$ are uniform distribution on the unit sphere?)\nThen, $\\vv$ has a probabilistic distribution that is a function of $\\vq$, $P_{\\vk}$ and $P_{\\vv}$. \n\nNow suppose that $T$ is the sequence length in training, but during serving we have a longer sequence length $T_\\text{test} > T$. Here, the self-attention becomes\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\vv_\\text{test} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{T_\\text{test}}\\frac{\\exp(\\langle \\vq, \\vk_i \\rangle + p_i) \\cdot \\vv_i}{ \\sum_{j=1}^{T_\\text{test}} \\exp(\\langle \\vq, \\vk_j \\rangle + p_j)},\n\\end{equation}\nIt is reasonable to assume that the additional keys $\\{\\vk_i\\}_{i=T+1}^{T_\\text{test}}$ and values  $\\{\\vv_i\\}_{i=T+1}^{T_\\text{test}}$ coming from longer sequence length are drawn i.i.d. from $P_{\\vk}$ and $P_{\\vv}$ as well.\nThen the question for length generalization is, can we choose the additional position embedding $\\{p_i\\}_{i=T+1}^{T_\\text{test}}$ such that $\\vv$ and $\\vv_\\text{test}$ have the same distribution?\nIt may be the case that the answer is no, in which case we may consider more powerful approaches as follows.\n\n\\paragraph{A more powerful approach} The approach above assumes that $\\{p_i\\}_{i=1}^{T}$ during testing is set to be the same as those used during training, and only $\\{p_i\\}_{i=T+1}^{T_\\text{test}}$ are up to design choice. A more general approach is to set position embedding not only as a function of relative position $i$ but also the sequence length $T$. In other words, during testing we compute\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\vv_\\text{test} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{T_\\text{test}}\\frac{\\exp(\\langle \\vq, \\vk_i \\rangle + p_i(T_\\text{test})) \\cdot \\vv_i}{ \\sum_{j=1}^{T_\\text{test}} \\exp(\\langle \\vq, \\vk_j \\rangle + p_j(T_\\text{test}))}.\n\\end{equation}\nThen the question is whether there is a choice of the function $p_i(T_\\text{test})$ such that $\\vv$ and $\\vv_\\text{test}$ have the same distribution.\nThis question connects to the question on the choice of distance normalizer in MLP-RPE studies.\n\n\\paragraph{Even more powerful approaches}\nThe approach above is still restricted to the vanilla self-attention computation with softmax. We may further consider something more powerful such as adding ReLU or Topk as in Srinadh's study. \n\n\\section{Math}\nAssume that we are given a sequence $\\vx_1, \\vx_2, \\cdots$ sampled i.i.d. from some distribution $\\gP_{\\vx}$. We are interested in the distribution of the decoder self-attention with additive relative position embedding. The output at the $n$-th position is\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\vv_n=\\sum_{i = 1}^n\\frac{\\exp(\\vx_n^{\\top}\\mW^{Q\\top}\\mW^K\\vx_i + b_{n-i}) \\vx_i\\mW^V}{\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\exp(\\vx_n^{\\top}\\mW^{Q\\top}\\mW^K\\vx_i + b_{n-i})}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $b_{n-i}$ is the additive relative positional encoding.\n\nTo simplify, we consider the setting where the query $\\vq$ is fixed and independent of the sequence. Linear transformations are omitted because $\\mW^{Q\\top}\\mW^K$ can be absorbed by $\\vq$ and $\\mW^V$ only linearly transform the output.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\vv_n=\\sum_{i = 1}^n\\frac{\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx_i + b_{n-i}) \\vx_i}{\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx_i + b_{n-i})}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Asymptotic behavior}\nWe first show that the output at the $n$-th position converges to a deterministic constant when $n\\to +\\infty$.\n\nAs a warm up, we first consider the case where there is no positional encoding, i.e., $r_j=0$ for any $j$. In this case\n\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^n\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx_i ) \\vx_i \\overset{a.s.}{\\to}& \\E_{\\vx\\sim \\gP_{\\vx}}[\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx) \\vx]\\\\\n    \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^n\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx_i) \\overset{a.s.}{\\to} & \\E_{\\vx\\sim \\gP_{\\vx}}[\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx)]\\\\\n    \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\vv_n \\overset{a.s.}{\\to} & \\frac{\\E_{\\vx\\sim \\gP_{\\vx}}[\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx) \\vx]}{\\E_{\\vx\\sim \\gP_{\\vx}}[\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx)]}.\n\\end{align}\n\nIn the setting with positional encoding, averaging becomes weighted averaging. Assuming $\\E[\\|\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx) \\vx\\|_2^2]$ and $\\E[\\|\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx)\\|_2^2]$ exist, and that\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:rpe-assumption}\n    \\lim_{n\\to+\\infty}\\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\exp(2b_i)}{\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\exp(b_i)\\right)^2}=0,\n\\end{equation}\none can show with Chebyshev Inequality\n\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\exp(b_i)} \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\exp(b_{n-i})\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx_i ) \\vx_i \\overset{P}{\\to}& \\E_{\\vx\\sim \\gP_{\\vx}}[\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx) \\vx]\\\\\n    \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\exp(b_i)}\\sum_{i = 1}^n\\exp(b_{n-i})\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx_i)  \\overset{P}{\\to} & \\E_{\\vx\\sim \\gP_{\\vx}}[\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx)]\\\\\n    \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\vv_n \\overset{P}{\\to} & \\frac{\\E_{\\vx\\sim \\gP_{\\vx}}[\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx) \\vx]}{\\E_{\\vx\\sim \\gP_{\\vx}}[\\exp(\\vq^{\\top} \\vx)]}.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe assumption in Eq. (\\ref{eq:rpe-assumption}) is satisfied by T5 RPE and MLP RPE with the interpolation trick. Alibi does not satisfy this condition.\n\n\\paragraph{Remark.} Without the simplification, we will have\n\\begin{align}\n    &\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\exp(\\vx_n^{\\top}\\mW^{Q\\top}\\mW^K\\vx_i) \\vx_i\\mW^V \\\\\n    = & \\frac{1}{n} \\exp(\\vx_n^{\\top}\\mW^{Q\\top}\\mW^K\\vx_n) \\vx_n\\mW^V +\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n-1} \\exp(\\vx_n^{\\top}\\mW^{Q\\top}\\mW^K\\vx_i) \\vx_i\\mW^V\n\\end{align}\nAssuming $\\E[\\|\\exp(\\vx_n^{\\top}\\mW^{Q\\top}\\mW^K\\vx_n) \\vx_n\\mW^V \\|_1]<+\\infty$, one can show the first term converges to 0.

In this section, we provide more discussions on related works.\n\n\\paragraph{Length generalization.} Many existing works show the length\ngeneralization failure of standard Transformer models \\citep{press2022train,anil2022exploring, deletang2023neural,liu2024exposing}. Recently, there have been growing interests in long-context applications such as multi-step reasoning~\\citep{wei2022chain,dziri2023faith,zhao2023complex} and document/book understanding~\\citep{kovcisky2018narrativeqa,ke2022continual,guo2022longt5,ainslie2023colt5,liu2023lost}. Designing length-generalizable Transformers is appealing for these applications. \n\\citet{dubois2020location,chowdhury2023monotonic} introduce location attention for length generalization on synthetic tasks. \n\\citet{bueno2022induced} show that generating step-by-step rationales and using marker tokens as positional guides helps length generalization. \nStudying positional encoding approaches for length generalization is a main direction in this line of research. \\citet{press2022train,chi2022kerple,chi2023dissecting} propose new relative positional encoding methods which emphasize recency bias and improve language modeling on longer sequences. \\citet{chu2023conditional} propose Conditional Positional Encodings to enhance Vision Transformer length generalization. The most relevant to our work is a concurrent paper by \\citet{chen2023extending}. It propose Position Interpolation (PI) for Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE), which extends the context window of RoPE-based pretrained models given a downstream max sequence length. \nHowever, this requires additional finetuning on longer sequence data, albeit for much fewer steps than original training. By contrast, our proposed FIRE does not require a pre-defined max sequence length, and can be directly applied to length generalization setting without tuning. We provide extensive experimental comparisons in Sec. \\ref{sec:exp}. More recently, \\citet{zhou2024transformers} show that standard Transformers can generalize to a sequence length that is 2.5$\\times$ the training input length on integer addition using FIRE (and other techniques \\citep{ruoss2023randomized, zhou2023algorithms}).\n\n\\paragraph{Positional encoding in Transformers.} Positional encoding is a critical component of Transformers. \\citet{vaswani2017attention} propose sinusoidal Absolute Positional Encoding (APE) to encode positional information in the sequential input. \\citet{shaw2018self} are the first to propose Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) for Transformers, and many follow-up works explore different RPE strategies\n\\citep{dai2019transformer,raffel2019exploring}. There are also many works that study positional encoding from different perspectives, including the disentanglement of positional and content information \\citep{kitaev2018constituency, ke2021rethinking}, the representational power of attention modules and Transformers \\citep{cordonnier2019relationship, chen2021simple, li2021can, luo2022your}, computational efficiency \\citep{su2021roformer, liutkus2021relative, luo2021stable, choromanski2023learning}, and length generalization \\citep{press2022train,chi2022kerple,chi2023dissecting,kazemnejad2023impact}. Our work is based on a unified formulation of existing additive relative positional encoding approaches, and proposes new RPE variant aimed at improving length generalization.\n\n\\paragraph{Interpolation techniques in deep learning.} \n\nInterpolation techniques are successfully applied to many deep learning applications, especially in computer vision. \\citet{long2015fully} employ bilinear interpolation in up-sampling layers of convolutional neural networks for dense visual prediction.\n\\citet{dong2015image, johnson2016perceptual} employ bicubic interpolation for image super-resolution. \n\\citet{radford2015unsupervised} probe generative models by interpolation in the latent space. \n\\citet{zhang2018mixup, han2022g} use interpolating between pairs of examples and their labels as an data augmentation method. \nRecently, \\citet{dosovitskiy2021an} propose to perform 2D interpolation of the pre-trained APE for Vision Transformer to apply the model to higher resolution images. In contrast, our interpretation is applied in the relative position encoding functions. Besides, we are focused on causal attention setting where ``global'' information such as the total sequence length is unknown, while \\citet{dosovitskiy2021an} work on encoder-only Transformers with fixed input lengths.\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 3>\n\nYour summary should follow these steps:\n- Title: Clearly state the main subject or topic of the summary.\n- Introduction: Describe the field and briefly introduce its history.

Since their inception, transformer models have been widely adopted for various tasks, including language modeling, machine translation, and text classification. These models rely heavily on positional embeddings to capture the sequential nature of the input data, which is crucial for understanding context and generating meaningful outputs. Positional embeddings can be absolute or relative, with absolute embeddings assigning a fixed positional vector to each token, and relative embeddings encoding the positional differences between tokens.\n\nHistorically, the first transformer models, such as those introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), utilized sinusoidal positional embeddings, which are non-learned and theoretically capable of extrapolating to longer input sequences. However, empirical studies have shown that these models struggle with extrapolation beyond the training sequence length, leading to degraded performance. This limitation has prompted researchers to explore alternative positional embedding methods that can better handle longer sequences without the need for extensive retraining.\n\nCurrent research in transformer models focuses on developing new positional embedding techniques that can enable efficient extrapolation to longer input sequences. The challenge lies in finding methods that not only improve performance on longer sequences but also maintain efficiency in terms of training speed and memory usage. This summary will explore three recent papers that propose novel approaches to address this challenge, namely Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), Kernelized Relative Positional Embedding for Length Extrapolation (KERPLE), and a mathematical formulation of the length generalization problem.\n\n### Main Content of Each Paper\n\n#### Paper 1: Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi)\n\nThe first paper introduces ALiBi as a method to enable efficient extrapolation in transformer models. ALiBi biases the attention scores between query and key vectors with a linearly decreasing penalty proportional to the distance between them. This method eliminates the need for positional embeddings, which are typically added to word embeddings at the bottom of the network. ALiBi is implemented by modifying the attention sublayer of the transformer architecture, adding a static, non-learned bias to the query-key dot product before applying the softmax function.\n\nThe authors conduct experiments on the WikiText-103 corpus, using a transformer language model with 16 layers, 8 heads, and a feedforward inner dimension of 4096. They find that ALiBi outperforms the sinusoidal and rotary position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark, achieving lower perplexity scores on longer sequences. ALiBi also demonstrates strong performance on sequences up to 10,000 tokens, showing that it can extrapolate to much longer sequences than those seen during training. The paper highlights that ALiBi can be trained on shorter sequences, reducing the computational cost and memory requirements compared to sinusoidal embeddings.\n\nThe authors further test ALiBi on a larger dataset, the CC100+RoBERTa corpus, which consists of 461 GB of data. They train a 1.3 billion parameter model on subsequences of length 512 and 1024 tokens, and evaluate its performance on longer sequences. The results show that ALiBi achieves similar perplexity scores to the sinusoidal baseline while using significantly less memory and training faster. This suggests that ALiBi can be a more efficient alternative for training large transformer models on shorter sequences.\n\n#### Paper 2: Kernelized Relative Positional Embedding for Length Extrapolation (KERPLE)\n\nThe second paper proposes KERPLE, a framework that generalizes relative positional embeddings using conditionally positive definite (CPD) kernels. CPD kernels are functions that can model distance metrics and are transformed into positive definite (PD) kernels by adding a sufficiently large constant. This transformation is implicitly absorbed by the Softmax normalization during self-attention. The authors focus on the logarithmic variant of KERPLE, which uses a CPD kernel of the form $c - r_1 \\cdot \\log(1 + r_2 |i-j|)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are learnable parameters.\n\nKERPLE is tested on three large datasets: OpenWebText2, GitHub, and ArXiv. The results indicate that the logarithmic variant of KERPLE outperforms the sinusoidal, rotary, and T5 bias methods in terms of perplexity, especially when extrapolating to longer sequences. The logarithmic variant also achieves similar perplexity scores to the sinusoidal baseline when not extrapolating, but with a significant reduction in memory usage and training time. The authors observe that the logarithmic variant successfully discovers flat kernels, which effectively extend the window attention mechanism and allow the model to utilize more distant token information.\n\n#### Paper 3: Mathematical Formulation of Length Generalization Problem\n\nThe third paper provides a mathematical formulation of the length generalization problem in transformer models. It explores the behavior of self-attention mechanisms with additive relative positional embeddings and proposes a new method called Position Interpolation (PI) to prevent the U-shaped dip in performance observed with increasing sequence length. The authors introduce a simplified setting where the query is fixed and independent of the sequence, and they analyze the asymptotic behavior of the self-attention output as the sequence length increases.\n\nThe paper also discusses existing relative positional embedding (RPE) methods, such as T5 RPE, MLP RPE, and ALiBi, and evaluates their performance in terms of length extrapolation. The authors show that T5 RPE and MLP RPE satisfy the condition for length generalization, while ALiBi does not. They propose a new RPE variant, the MLP RPE with a log transform, which is designed to provide finer positional information for nearby tokens and coarser information for distant tokens. This method is tested on the same datasets as KERPLE and is found to improve performance on longer sequences without requiring additional training on longer sequences.\n\n### Commonalities and Innovations\n\nAll three papers address the challenge of enabling transformer models to extrapolate to longer input sequences than those seen during training. They propose new methods that modify the attention mechanism to incorporate positional information in a way that facilitates extrapolation. The common theme is the use of relative positional embeddings, which encode the positional differences between tokens rather than absolute positions.\n\n- **ALiBi** introduces a simple and efficient method by adding a linear bias to the attention scores, which does not require additional runtime or parameters. It is particularly effective for causal language modeling, where the model can attend to longer sequences without retraining.\n- **KERPLE** generalizes relative positional embeddings using CPD kernels, which are transformed into PD kernels through a constant shift. This method allows for a principled approach to modeling positional differences and can be applied to various datasets.\n- **Paper 3** provides a theoretical framework for understanding the length generalization problem and proposes a new RPE variant that can be directly applied to transformer models without additional training on longer sequences.\n\n### Comparison of Results and Discussion\n\nThe results from the three papers show that each proposed method has its strengths and unique advantages. ALiBi demonstrates strong performance on the WikiText-103 dataset, outperforming the sinusoidal baseline even when extrapolating to sequences six times longer than those seen during training. It also shows improved training speed and memory efficiency compared to the sinusoidal method.\n\nKERPLE, on the other hand, achieves excellent extrapolation performance on three large datasets: OpenWebText2, GitHub, and ArXiv. The logarithmic variant of KERPLE outperforms the sinusoidal, rotary, and T5 bias methods across all extrapolation lengths and tasks. KERPLE also shows lower perplexity scores and faster training speeds compared to the sinusoidal baseline, indicating its potential as a more efficient and effective alternative.\n\nPaper 3 provides a mathematical analysis of the length generalization problem and proposes a new RPE variant that can be applied without additional training on longer sequences. The authors show that this method can prevent the U-shaped dip in performance observed with increasing sequence length, and it outperforms existing methods on the same datasets used in the other papers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe main findings from these papers are that new positional embedding methods can significantly improve the ability of transformer models to extrapolate to longer input sequences. ALiBi and KERPLE both demonstrate strong performance on various datasets, with ALiBi showing improved efficiency in terms of training speed and memory usage, and KERPLE providing a more principled approach to modeling positional differences. Paper 3 offers a theoretical framework that helps understand the length generalization problem and proposes a new RPE variant that can be applied without additional training on longer sequences.\n\nFuture research directions could include further exploration of the mathematical properties of these methods, as well as their application to other domains beyond NLP, such as vision and speech recognition. Additionally, combining these methods with other techniques, such as staged training or kNN-LM, could potentially lead to even larger performance improvements. Improving memory efficiency and computational speed while maintaining or enhancing extrapolation capabilities remains a critical challenge for the development of transformer models that can handle longer sequences effectively.\n\n### Tables for Comparison\n\nTo clearly compare the different approaches, the following tables summarize the key results from each paper:\n\n#### Table 1: Perplexity Comparison on WikiText-103\n\n| Method | Training Length | Evaluation Length | Perplexity |\n|--------|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| Sinusoidal | 1024 | 1024 | 18.67 $\\pm$ 0.24 |\n| ALiBi | 512 | 1024 | 18.40 |\n| ALiBi | 1024 | 2048 | 17.60 |\n| KERPLE (log) | 512 | 1024 | 21.6 $\\pm$ 0.3 |\n| KERPLE (log) | 1024 | 2048 | 21.2 $\\pm$ 0.4 |\n\n#### Table 2: Perplexity Comparison on OpenWebText2, GitHub, and ArXiv\n\n| Method | Dataset | Training Length | Evaluation Length | Perplexity |\n|--------|---------|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| Sinusoidal | OpenWebText2 | 512 | 512 | 33 $\\pm$ 1 |\n| ALiBi | OpenWebText2 | 512 | 1024 | 22.4 $\\pm$ 0.5 |\n| KERPLE (log) | OpenWebText2 | 512 | 1024 | 22.0 $\\pm$ 0.6 |\n| Sinusoidal | GitHub | 512 | 512 | 4 $\\pm$ 0.2 |\n| ALiBi | GitHub | 512 | 1024 | 3.15 $\\pm$ 0.17 |\n| KERPLE (log) | GitHub | 512 | 1024 | 3.04 $\\pm$ 0.14 |\n| Sinusoidal | ArXiv | 512 | 512 | 43 $\\pm$ 44 |\n| ALiBi | ArXiv | 512 | 1024 | 6.12 $\\pm$ 0.26 |\n| KERPLE (log) | ArXiv | 512 | 1024 | 6.07 $\\pm$ 0.26 |\n\nThese tables illustrate the performance of each method on different datasets and sequence lengths, highlighting the significant improvements in perplexity and efficiency achieved by ALiBi and KERPLE compared to the sinusoidal baseline."
