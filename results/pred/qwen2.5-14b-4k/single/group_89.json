Real-world tabular datasets have interdependent feature columns, e.g., the education level can be guessed from the occupation, or the gender can be guessed from the relationship. Unsupervised representation learning by masked self-supervised learning results in an improved encoder model for the supervised learning task.}\n\\label{fig:self_supervised}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe propose a new canonical DNN architecture for tabular data, TabNet.\nThe main contributions are summarized as:\n\\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep, leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\emph{TabNet inputs raw tabular data without any preprocessing} and is \\emph{trained using gradient descent-based optimization}, enabling flexible integration into end-to-end learning. \n\\item \\emph{TabNet uses sequential attention to choose which features to reason from at each decision step}, enabling interpretability and better learning as the learning capacity is used for the most salient features (see Fig. \\ref{fig:simplified_tabnet}). \nThis feature selection is \\emph{instance-wise}, e.g. it can be different for each input, and unlike other instance-wise feature selection methods like \\citep{l2x} or \\citep{invase}, TabNet employs a \\emph{single deep learning architecture for feature selection and reasoning}. \n\\item Above design choices lead to two valuable properties: (i) \\emph{TabNet outperforms or is on par with other tabular learning models} on various datasets for classification and regression problems from different domains; and (ii) \\emph{TabNet enables two kinds of interpretability}: local interpretability that visualizes the importance of features and how they are combined, and global interpretability which quantifies the contribution of each feature to the trained model. \n\\item Finally, \\emph{for the first time for tabular data}, we show significant performance improvements by using unsupervised pre-training to predict masked features (see Fig. \\ref{fig:self_supervised}). \n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\noindent\\newline{\\bf Feature selection:} Feature selection broadly refers to judiciously picking a subset of features based on their usefulness for prediction. \nCommonly-used techniques such as forward selection and Lasso regularization \\citep{feature_selection} attribute feature importance based on the entire training data, and are referred as \\emph{global} methods. \n\\emph{Instance-wise} feature selection refers to picking features individually for each input, studied in \\citep{l2x} with an explainer model to maximize the mutual information between the selected features and the response variable, and in \\citep{invase} by using an actor-critic framework to mimic a baseline while optimizing the selection. \nUnlike these, TabNet employs \\emph{soft feature selection with controllable sparsity in end-to-end learning} -- a single model jointly performs feature selection and output mapping, resulting in superior performance with compact representations.\n\\begin{figure*}[!htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.86\\textwidth]{dt_func.pdf}\n\\caption{\nIllustration of DT-like classification using conventional DNN blocks (left) and the corresponding decision manifold (right).\nRelevant features are selected by using multiplicative sparse masks on inputs. \nThe selected features are linearly transformed, and after a bias addition (to represent boundaries) ReLU performs region selection by zeroing the regions. \nAggregation of multiple regions is based on addition. \nAs $C_1$ and $C_2$ get larger, the decision boundary gets sharper.}\n\\label{fig:dt_func}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\noindent\\newline{\\bf Tree-based learning:} DTs are commonly-used for tabular data learning. Their prominent strength is efficient picking of global features with the most statistical information gain \\citep{decisiontree1}. \nTo improve the performance of standard DTs, one common approach is ensembling to reduce variance. \nAmong ensembling methods, random forests \\citep{random_forest} use random subsets of data with randomly selected features to grow many trees. XGBoost \\citep{XGBoost} and LightGBM \\citep{lightgbm} are the two recent ensemble DT approaches that dominate most of the recent data science competitions. \nOur experimental results for various datasets show that tree-based models can be outperformed when the representation capacity is improved with deep learning while retaining their feature selecting property.\n\\noindent\\newline{\\bf Integration of DNNs into DTs:} \nRepresenting DTs with DNN building blocks as in \\citep{DNN_init_tree} yields redundancy in representation and inefficient learning. \nSoft (neural) DTs \\citep{neural_randomforest,neural_decisionforest} use differentiable decision functions, instead of non-differentiable axis-aligned splits. \nHowever, losing automatic feature selection often degrades performance. \nIn \\citep{dndt}, a soft binning function is proposed to simulate DTs in DNNs, by inefficiently enumerating of all possible decisions. \n\\citep{tabnn} proposes a DNN architecture by explicitly leveraging expressive feature combinations, however, learning is based on transferring knowledge from gradient-boosted DT.\n\\citep{ant} proposes a DNN architecture by adaptively growing from primitive blocks while representation learning into edges, routing functions and leaf nodes. \nTabNet differs from these as it embeds soft feature selection with controllable sparsity via sequential attention. \n\\noindent\\newline{\\bf Self-supervised learning:}\nUnsupervised representation learning improves supervised learning especially in small data regime \\citep{self_taught}. \nRecent work for text \\citep{bert} and image \\citep{selfie} data has shown significant advances -- driven by the judicious choice of the unsupervised learning objective (masked input prediction) and attention-based deep learning.\n\n\\section{TabNet for Tabular Learning}\n\nDTs are successful for learning from real-world tabular datasets. \nWith a specific design, conventional DNN building blocks can be used to implement DT-like output manifold, e.g. see Fig. \\ref{fig:dt_func}).\nIn such a design, individual feature selection is key to obtain decision boundaries in hyperplane form, which can be generalized to a linear combination of features where coefficients determine the proportion of each feature. \nTabNet is based on such functionality and it outperforms DTs while reaping their benefits by careful design which:\n(i) uses sparse instance-wise feature selection learned from data; \n(ii) constructs a sequential multi-step architecture, where each step contributes to a portion of the decision based on the selected features;\n(iii) improves the learning capacity via non-linear processing of the selected features; and \n(iv) mimics ensembling via higher dimensions and more steps.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!htbp]\n\\centering\n\\vspace{0cm}\n\\subfigure[TabNet encoder architecture]{\\includegraphics[width=0.57\\textwidth]{tabnet_encoder.pdf}}\n\\vspace{0cm}\n\\subfigure[TabNet decoder architecture]{\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{tabnet_decoder.pdf}}\n\\vspace{0cm}\n\\subfigure[ ]{\\includegraphics[width=0.6\\textwidth]{feature_transform.pdf}}\n\\hspace{0.3cm}\n\\subfigure[ ]{\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{attn_transform.pdf}}\n\\caption{(a) TabNet encoder, composed of a feature transformer, an attentive transformer and feature masking. \nA split block divides the processed representation to be used by the attentive transformer of the subsequent step as well as for the overall output. \nFor each step, the feature selection mask provides interpretable information about the model's functionality, and the masks can be aggregated to obtain global feature important attribution. \n(b) TabNet decoder, composed of a feature transformer block at each step. \n(c) A feature transformer block example -- 4-layer network is shown, where 2 are shared across all decision steps and 2 are decision step-dependent. \nEach layer is composed of a fully-connected (FC) layer, BN and GLU nonlinearity. \n(d) An attentive transformer block example -- a single layer mapping is modulated with a prior scale information which aggregates how much each feature has been used before the current decision step. \nsparsemax \\citep{sparsemax} is used for normalization of the coefficients, resulting in sparse selection of the salient features.\n\\vspace{0cm}\n}\n\n\\label{fig:tabnet}\n\\label{fig:feature_transform}\n\\label{fig:attn_transform}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFig. \\ref{fig:tabnet} shows the TabNet architecture for encoding tabular data. \nWe use the raw numerical features and consider mapping of categorical features with trainable embeddings.\nWe do not consider any global feature normalization, but merely apply batch normalization (BN). \nWe pass the same $D$-dimensional features $\\mathbf{f} \\in \\Re ^ {B \\times D}$ to each decision step, where $B$ is the batch size. \nTabNet's encoding is based on sequential multi-step processing with $N_{steps}$ decision steps. \nThe $i^{th}$ step inputs the processed information from the $(i-1)^{th}$ step to decide which features to use and outputs the processed feature representation to be aggregated into the overall decision. \nThe idea of top-down attention in the sequential form is inspired by its applications in processing visual and text data \\citep{compositional_attention} and reinforcement learning \\citep{S3A} while searching for a small subset of relevant information in high dimensional input. \n\\noindent\\newline{\\bf Feature selection:}\nWe employ a learnable mask $\\mathbf{M[i]} \\in \\Re ^ {B \\times D}$ for soft selection of the salient features. Through sparse selection of the most salient features, the learning capacity of a decision step is not wasted on irrelevant ones, and thus the model becomes more parameter efficient. The masking is multiplicative, $\\mathbf{M[i]} \\cdot \\mathbf{f}$. We use an attentive transformer (see Fig. \\ref{fig:attn_transform}) to obtain the masks using the processed features from the preceding step, $\\mathbf{a[i-1]}$:\n$\n\\mathbf{M[i]} = \\text{sparsemax}(\\mathbf{P[i-1]} \\cdot \\text{h}_i(\\mathbf{a[i-1]})).\n$\nSparsemax normalization \\citep{sparsemax} encourages sparsity by mapping the Euclidean projection onto the probabilistic simplex, which is observed to be superior in performance and aligned with the goal of sparse feature selection for explainability. Note that $\\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^{D} \\mathbf{M[i]_{b,j}} = 1$. $\\text{h}_i$ is a trainable function, shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:attn_transform} using a FC layer, followed by BN. $\\mathbf{P[i]}$ is the prior scale term, denoting how much a particular feature has been used previously:\n$\n\\mathbf{P[i]} = \\prod\\nolimits_{j=1}^{i} (\\gamma - \\mathbf{M[j]}), \n$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is a relaxation parameter -- when $\\gamma=1$, a feature is enforced to be used only at one decision step and as $\\gamma$ increases, more flexibility is provided to use a feature at multiple decision steps. $\\mathbf{P[0]}$ is initialized as all ones, $\\mathbf{1} ^ {B \\times D}$, without any prior on the masked features. If some features are unused (as in self-supervised learning), corresponding $\\mathbf{P[0]}$ entries are made 0 to help model's learning.\nTo further control the sparsity of the selected features, we propose sparsity regularization in the form of entropy  \\citep{entropy_ssl},\n$L_{sparse} = \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{N_{steps}} \\sum\\nolimits_{b=1}^{B} \\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^{D} \\frac{-\\mathbf{M_{b,j}[i]} \\log(\\mathbf{M_{b,j}[i]} \\! +\\!  \\epsilon)}{N_{steps} \\cdot B},$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is a small number for numerical stability. We add the sparsity regularization to the overall loss, with a coefficient $\\lambda_{sparse}$. Sparsity provides a favorable inductive bias for datasets where most features are redundant.\n\\noindent\\newline{\\bf Feature processing:}\nWe process the filtered features using a feature transformer (see Fig. \\ref{fig:feature_transform}) and then split for the decision step output and information for the subsequent step,\n$[\\mathbf{d[i]}, \\mathbf{a[i]}] = \\text{f}_i(\\mathbf{M[i]} \\cdot \\mathbf{f})$,\nwhere $\\mathbf{d[i]} \\in \\Re ^ {B \\times N_d}$ and $\\mathbf{a[i]} \\in \\Re ^ {B \\times N_a}$. For parameter-efficient and robust learning with high capacity, a feature transformer should comprise layers that are shared across all decision steps (as the same features are input across different decision steps), as well as decision step-dependent layers. Fig. \\ref{fig:attn_transform} shows the implementation as concatenation of two shared layers and two decision step-dependent layers. Each FC layer is followed by BN and gated linear unit (GLU) nonlinearity \\citep{glu},\neventually connected to a normalized residual connection with normalization. Normalization with $\\sqrt{0.5}$ helps to stabilize learning by ensuring that the variance throughout the network does not change dramatically \\citep{convseq2seq}. For faster training, we use large batch sizes with BN. Thus, except the one applied to the input features, we use ghost BN \\citep{ghost_batch_norm} form, using a virtual batch size $B_V$ and momentum $m_B$. For the input features, we observe the benefit of low-variance averaging and hence avoid ghost BN. \nFinally, inspired by decision-tree like aggregation as in Fig. \\ref{fig:dt_func}, we construct the overall decision embedding as $\\mathbf{d_{out}} = \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{N_{steps}} \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{d[i]})$.\nWe apply a linear mapping $\\mathbf{W_{final}} \\mathbf{d_{out}}$ to get the output mapping.\\footnote{For discrete outputs, we additionally employ softmax during training (and argmax during inference).}\n\\noindent\\newline{\\textbf{Interpretability:}}\nTabNet's feature selection masks can shed light on the selected features at each step. \nIf $\\mathbf{M_{b,j}[i]} = 0$, then $j^{th}$ feature of the $b^{th}$ sample should have no contribution to the decision. \nIf $\\text{f}_i$ were a linear function, the coefficient $\\mathbf{M_{b,j}[i]}$ would correspond to the feature importance of $\\mathbf{f_{b,j}}$. \nAlthough each decision step employs non-linear processing, their outputs are combined later in a linear way. \nWe aim to quantify an aggregate feature importance in addition to analysis of each step. \nCombining the masks at different steps requires a coefficient that can weigh the relative importance of each step in the decision. \nWe simply propose $\\mathbf{\\eta_b[i]} =\\sum_{c=1}^{N_d} \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{d_{b,c}[i]})$ to denote the aggregate decision contribution at $i^{th}$ decision step for the $b^{th}$ sample.\nIntuitively, if $\\mathbf{d_{b,c}[i]} < 0$, then all features at $i^{th}$ decision step should have 0 contribution to the overall decision.\nAs its value increases, it plays a higher role in the overall linear combination. Scaling the decision mask at each decision step with $\\mathbf{\\eta_b[i]}$, we propose the aggregate feature importance mask,\n$\\mathbf{M_{agg-b,j}} \\! = \\! \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{N_{steps}}\\! \\mathbf{\\eta_{b}[i]} \\mathbf{M_{b,j}[i]} \\Big/ \\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^{D} \\! \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{N_{steps}} \\! \\mathbf{\\eta_{b}[i]} \\mathbf{M_{b,j}[i]}.$\\footnote{Normalization is used to ensure $\\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^{D} \\mathbf{M_{agg-b,j}}=1$.}\n\n\\begin{table*}[!htbp]\n\\caption{Mean and std. of test area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) on 6 synthetic datasets from \\citep{l2x}, for TabNet vs. other feature selection-based DNN models: No sel.: using all features without any feature selection, Global: using only globally-salient features, Tree Ensembles \\citep{Geurts2006}, Lasso-regularized model, L2X \\citep{l2x} and INVASE \\citep{invase}.

The decoder is composed of feature transformers, followed by FC layers at each decision step. The outputs are summed to obtain the reconstructed features.\nWe propose the task of prediction of missing feature columns from the others. Consider a binary mask $\\mathbf{S} \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\} ^ {B \\times D}$.  \nThe TabNet encoder inputs $(\\mathbf{1} - \\mathbf{S}) \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{f}}$ and the decoder outputs the reconstructed features, $\\mathbf{S} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{f}}$. \nWe initialize $\\mathbf{P[0]} = (\\mathbf{1} - \\mathbf{S})$ in encoder so that the model emphasizes merely on the known features, and the decoder's last FC layer is multiplied with $\\mathbf{S}$ to output the unknown features. \nWe consider the reconstruction loss in self-supervised phase:\n$\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\sum_{j=1}^{D} \\left | \n\\frac{ ({\\mathbf{\\hat{f}_{b,j}}} - \\mathbf{f_{b,j}}) \\cdot \\mathbf{\\mathbf{S_{b,j}}}}\n{\\sqrt{\\sum_{b=1}^{B} (\\mathbf{f_{b,j}} - {1/B} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\mathbf{f_{b,j}})^{2}}}\n\\right | ^2.\n$\nNormalization with the population standard deviation of the ground truth is beneficial, as the features may have different ranges. We sample $\\mathbf{S_{b,j}}$ independently from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p_s$, at each iteration. \n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\vspace{0cm}\n\nWe study TabNet in wide range of problems, that contain regression or classification tasks, \\emph{particularly with published benchmarks}. \nFor all datasets, categorical inputs are mapped to a single-dimensional trainable scalar with a learnable embedding\\footnote{In some cases, higher dimensional embeddings may slightly improve the performance, but interpretation of individual dimensions may become challenging.} and numerical columns are input without and preprocessing.\\footnote{Specially-designed feature engineering, e.g. logarithmic transformation of variables highly-skewed distributions, may further improve the results but we leave it out of the scope of this paper.}\nWe use standard classification (softmax cross entropy) and regression (mean squared error) loss functions and we train until convergence. Hyperparameters of the TabNet models are optimized on a validation set and listed in Appendix. TabNet performance is not very sensitive to most hyperparameters as shown with ablation studies in Appendix. In Appendix, we also present ablation studies on various design and guidelines on selection of the key hyperparameters.\nFor all experiments we cite, we use the same training, validation and testing data split with the original work. Adam optimization algorithm \\citep{adam} and Glorot uniform initialization are used for training of all models.\\footnote{An open-source implementation will be released.}\n\n\\subsection{Instance-wise feature selection}\n\\label{performance_section}\n\\vspace{0cm}\nSelection of the salient features is crucial for high performance, especially for small datasets. We consider 6 tabular datasets from \\citep{l2x} (consisting 10k training samples). The datasets are constructed in such a way that only a subset of the features determine the output. For Syn1-Syn3, salient features are same for all instances (e.g., the output of Syn2 depends on features $X_3$-$X_6$), and global feature selection, as if the salient features were known, would give high performance. For Syn4-Syn6, salient features are instance dependent (e.g., for Syn4, the output depends on either $X_1$-$X_2$ or $X_3$-$X_6$ depending on the value of $X_{11}$), which makes global feature selection suboptimal.\nTable \\ref{table:feature_selection} shows that TabNet outperforms others (Tree Ensembles \\citep{Geurts2006}, LASSO regularization, L2X \\citep{l2x}) and is on par with INVASE \\citep{invase}. For Syn1-Syn3, TabNet performance is close to global feature selection - \\emph{it can figure out what features are globally important}. For Syn4-Syn6, eliminating instance-wise redundant features, TabNet improves global feature selection.\nAll other methods utilize a predictive model with 43k parameters, and the total number of parameters is 101k for INVASE due to the two other models in the actor-critic framework. TabNet is a single architecture, and its size is 26k for Syn1-Syn3 and 31k for Syn4-Syn6. The compact representation is one of TabNet's valuable properties. \n\n\\vspace{0cm}\n\\subsection{Performance on real-world datasets} \n\n\\bgroup\n\\def\\arraystretch{0.95}\n\\begin{table}[h!]\n\\vspace{0cm}\n\\caption{Performance for Forest Cover Type dataset.}\n\\vspace{0cm}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|C{4.9 cm}|C{2.5 cm}|}\n\\cline{1-2}\n\\textit{Model} & \\textit{Test accuracy (\\%)}        \\\\ \\cline{1-2}\nXGBoost &  89.34                \\\\ \\cline{1-2}\nLightGBM  & 89.28              \\\\ \\cline{1-2}\nCatBoost & 85.14              \\\\ \\cline{1-2} \nAutoML Tables  & 94.95                  \\\\ \\cline{1-2}\n\\textit{TabNet}  &  \\textbf{96.99}  \\\\ \\cline{1-2}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{table:covertype}\n\\end{table}\n\\egroup\n\n\\noindent\\newline{\\bf Forest Cover Type \\citep{UCI}:} The task is classification of forest cover type from cartographic variables.

Many machine learning competitions such as Kaggle and KDD Cup are primarily designed to solve problems in tabular domain. \n\nThe state-of-the-art for modeling tabular data is tree-based ensemble methods such as the gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) \\citep{chen2016xgboost, prokhorenkova2018catboost}. This is in contrast to modeling image and text data where \nall the existing competitive models are based on deep learning \\citep{sandler2018mobilenetv2, Devlin2019BERTPO}. \nThe tree-based ensemble models can achieve competitive prediction accuracy, are fast to train and easy to interpret. These benefits make them highly favourable among machine learning practitioners. However,\nthe tree-based models have several limitations in comparison to deep learning models. \n(a) They are not suitable for continual training from streaming data, and do not allow efficient end-to-end learning of image/text encoders in presence of multi-modality along with tabular data. \n(b) In their basic form they are not suitable for state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. This is due to the fact that the basic decision tree learner does not produce reliable probability estimation to its predictions  \\citep{Tanha2017SemisupervisedSF}.\n(c) The state-of-the-art deep learning methods \\citep{Devlin2019BERTPO} to handle missing and noisy data features do not apply to them. Also, robustness of tree-based models has not been studied much in literature. \n\nA classical and popular model that is trained using gradient descent and hence allows end-to-end learning of image/text encoders is multi-layer perceptron (MLP). %When handling data with categorical variables, each value of a categorical variable is typically matched to a learned embedding, and these embeddings are passed, along with the numeric variables, to the feed forward network. \nThe MLPs usually learn parametric embeddings to encode categorical data features. But due  to  their  shallow  architecture and context-free embeddings,  they  have  the  following limitations: \n(a) neither the model nor the learned embeddings are interpretable; (b) it is not robust against missing and noisy data (Section \\ref{subsec: The Robustness}); \n(c) for semi-supervised learning, they do not achieve competitive performance (Section \\ref{subsec: semi-supervised-learning}). %and are not amenable to state-of-the-art masked self-supervised pre-training. \\xh{I would delete ``masked self-supervised learing'' part as nobody admits this is state of the art and we don't talk about that in previous section}\nMost importantly, MLPs do not match the performance of tree-based models such as GBDT on most of the datasets \\citep{arik2019tabnet}. To bridge this performance gap between MLP and GBDT, researchers have proposed various deep learning models \\citep{song_autoint_2019, cheng2016wide, arik2019tabnet, guo_deepfm_2018}. Although these deep learning models achieve comparable prediction accuracy, \nthey do not address all the limitations of GBDT and MLP.  \nFurthermore, their comparisons are done in a limited setting of a handful of datasets. In particular, in Section~\\ref{subsec: supervised-learning} we show that when compared to standard GBDT on a large collection of datasets, GBDT perform significantly better than these recent models. %\\zk{just added this last sentence - please delete it if it's too much}\n\nIn this paper, we propose TabTransformer to address the limitations of MLPs and existing deep learning models, while bridging the performance gap between MLP and GBDT. We establish performance gain of TabTransformer through extensive experiments on fifteen publicly available datasets. \n\nThe TabTransformer is built upon Transformers \\citep{vaswani2017attention} to learn efficient contextual embeddings of categorical features. \nDifferent from tabular domain, the application of embeddings has been studied extensively in NLP. \nThe use of embeddings to encode words in a dense low dimensional space is prevalent in natural language processing. Beginning from Word2Vec \\citep{rong2014word2vec} with the context-free word embeddings to BERT \\citep{Devlin2019BERTPO} which provides the contextual word-token embeddings, embeddings have been widely studied and applied in practice in NLP. In comparison to context-free embeddings, the contextual embedding based models \\cite{mikolov2011extensions, huang2015bidirectional, Devlin2019BERTPO} have achieved tremendous success. In particular, self-attention based Transformers \\citep{vaswani2017attention} have become a standard component of NLP models to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The effectiveness and interpretability of contextual embeddings generated by Transformers have been also well studied \\citep{coenen2019visualizing, brunner2019validity}.\n\nMotivated by the successful applications of Transformers in NLP,\nwe adapt them %to use \nin tabular domain. \nIn particular, TabTransformer applies a sequence of multi-head attention-based Transformer layers on parametric embeddings to transform them into contextual embeddings, bridging the performance gap between baseline MLP and GBDT models. We investigate the effectiveness and interpretability of the resulting contextual embeddings generated by the Transformers. We find that highly correlated features (including feature pairs in the same column and cross column) result in embedding vectors that are close together in Euclidean distance,\nwhereas no such pattern exists in context-free embeddings learned in a baseline MLP model. We also study the robustness of the TabTransformer against random missing and noisy data. The contextual embeddings make them highly robust in comparison to MLPs. %that use context-free embeddings. \n\nFurthermore, many existing deep learning models for tabular data are designed for supervised learning scenario but few are for semi-supervised leanring (SSL). Unfortunately, the state-of-art SSL models developed in computer vision \\citep{voulodimos2018deep, kendall2017uncertainties} and NLP \\citep{vaswani2017attention, Devlin2019BERTPO} cannot be easily extended to tabular domain. Motivated by such challenges, we exploit pre-training methodologies from the language models and propose a semi-supervised learning approach for pre-training Transformers of our TabTransformer model using unlabeled data. \n\nOne of the key benefits of our proposed method for semi-supervised learning is the two independent training phases: \na costly pre-training phase on unlabeled data and a lightweight fine-tuning phase on labeled data. \nThis differs from many state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods \\citep{chapelle2009semi, oliver2018realistic, stretcu_graph_2019} that require a single training job including both the labeled and unlabeled data. \nThe separated training procedure benefits the scenario where the model needs to be pretrained once but fine-tuned multiple times for multiple target variables.\nThis scenario is in fact quite common in the industrial setting as companies tend to have one large dataset (e.g.\\ describing customers/products) and are interested in applying multiple analyses on this data. %\\zk{added a sentence to motivate the single pre-training, multiple fine-tuning option}\nTo summarize, we provide the following contributions: \n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item We propose TabTransformer, an architecture that provides and exploits contextual embeddings of categorical features. We provide extensive empirical evidence showing TabTransformer\nis superior to both a baseline MLP and recent deep networks for tabular data while matching the performance of tree-based ensemble models (GBDT).\n\n\\item We investigate the resulting contextual embeddings and highlight their interpretability, contrasted to parametric context-free embeddings achieved by existing art.\n\n\\item We demonstrate the robustness of TabTransformer against noisy and missing data. %\\zk{deleted `in comparison to MLPs' TMI for the intro}\n\n\\item We provide and extensively study a two-phase pre-training then fine-tune procedure for tabular data, beating the state-of-the-art performance of semi-supervised learning methods.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{The TabTransformer}\\label{sec:TabTransformer}\nThe TabTransformer architecture comprises a column embedding layer, a stack of $N$ Transformer layers, and a multi-layer perceptron. Each Transformer layer \\citep{vaswani2017attention} consists of a multi-head self-attention layer followed by a position-wise feed-forward layer. The architecture of TabTransformer is shown below in Figure \\ref{fig:architecture}.\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{TabIllustration2.png} \n\\caption{The architecture of TabTransformer.}\n\\label{fig:architecture}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLet $(\\bm{x}, y)$ denote a feature-target pair,  where $\\bm{x} \\equiv \\{\\bm{x}_{\\text{cat}}, \\bm{x}_{\\text{cont}}\\}$. The $\\bm{x}_{\\text{cat}}$ denotes all the categorical features and $\\bm{x}_{\\text{cont}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{c}$ denotes all of the $c$ continuous features. Let $\\bm{x}_{\\text{cat}} \\equiv \\{x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_m\\}$ with each $x_i$ being a categorical feature, for $i \\in \\{1,\\cdots, m\\}$. \n\nWe embed each of the $x_i$ categorical features into a parametric embedding of dimension $d$ using \\textit{Column embedding}, which is explained below in detail. Let $\\bm{e}_{{\\phi}_i}(x_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ for $i \\in \\{1,\\cdots,m\\}$ be the embedding of the $x_i$ feature, and $\\bm{E}_{\\phi}(\\bm{x}_{\\text{cat}}) = \\{\\bm{e}_{{\\phi}_1}(x_1),\\cdots,  \\bm{e}_{{\\phi}_m}(x_m)\\}$ be the set of embeddings for all the categorical features. \n\nNext, these parametric embeddings $\\bm{E}_{\\phi}(\\bm{x}_{\\text{cat}})$ are inputted to the first Transformer layer. The output of the first Transformer layer is inputted to the second layer Transformer, and so forth.\nEach parametric embedding is transformed into contextual embedding when outputted from the top layer Transformer, through successive aggregation of context from other embeddings. We denote the sequence of Transformer layers as a function $f_{\\theta}$. The function $f_{\\theta}$ operates on parametric embeddings $\\{\\bm{e}_{{\\phi}_1}(x_1),\\cdots, \\bm{e}_{{\\phi}_m}(x_m)\\}$ and returns the corresponding contextual embeddings $\\{\\bm{h}_1,\\cdots, \\bm{h}_m\\}$ where $\\bm{h}_i\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ for $i \\in \\{1,\\cdots, m\\}$.\n\nThe contextual embeddings $\\{\\bm{h}_1,\\cdots, \\bm{h}_m\\}$ are concatenated along with the continuous features $\\bm{x}_{\\text{cont}}$ to form a vector of dimension $(d\\times m + c)$. This vector is inputted to an MLP, denoted by $g_{\\bm{\\psi}}$, to predict the target $y$. Let $H$ be the cross-entropy for classification tasks and mean square error for regression tasks. We minimize the following loss function $\\mathcal{L}(\\bm{x}, y)$ to learn all the TabTransformer parameters in an end-to-end learning by the first-order gradient methods. The TabTransformer parameters include $\\bm{\\phi}$ for column embedding, $\\bm{\\theta}$ for Transformer layers, and $\\bm{\\psi}$ for the top MLP layer.\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{equaton: supervised-loss}\n\\mathcal{L}(\\bm{x}, y) \\equiv H( g_{\\bm{\\psi}}(f_{\\bm{\\bm{\\theta}\n}}(\\bm{E}_{\\phi}(\\bm{x}_{\\text{cat}})), \\bm{x}_{\\text{cont}}), y)\\,.\n\\end{align}\nBelow, we explain the Transformer layers and column embedding.\n\n\\subsubsection{Transformer.} A Transformer \\citep{vaswani2017attention} consists of a multi-head self-attention layer followed by a position-wise feed-forward layer, with element-wise addition and layer-normalization being done after each layer.\nA self-attention layer comprises three parametric matrices - Key, Query and Value. Each input embedding is projected on to these matrices, to generate their key, query and value vectors. \nFormally, let $K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times k}$, $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times k}$ and $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times v}$ be the matrices comprising key, query and value vectors of all the embeddings, respectively, and $m$ be the number of embeddings inputted to the Transformer, $k$ and $v$ be the dimensions of the key and value vectors, respectively. Every input embedding attends to all other embeddings through a Attention head, which is computed as follows:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\text{Attention}(K, Q, V) = A \\cdot V,  \n\\end{align}\nwhere $A = \\text{softmax}({(QK^T)}/{\\sqrt{k}})$. For each embedding, the attention matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ calculates how much it attends to other embeddings, thus transforming the embedding into contextual one. The output of the attention head of dimension $v$ is projected back to the embedding of dimension $d$ through a fully connected layer, which in turn is passed through two position-wise feed-forward layers. The first layer expands the embedding to four times its size and the second layer projects it back to its original size. \n\n\\subsubsection{Column embedding.} For each categorical feature (column) $i$, we have an embedding lookup table $\\bm{e}_{{\\phi}_i}(.)$, for $i \\in \\{1,2,...,m\\}$. For $i$th feature with $d_i$ classes, the embedding table $\\bm{e}_{{\\phi}_i}(.)$ has $(d_{i}+1)$ embeddings where the additional embedding corresponds to a missing value.\nThe embedding for the encoded value $x_i = j \\in [0, 1, 2, .., d_i]$ is $\\bm{e}_{{\\phi}_i}(j) = [\\bm{c}_{\\phi_i}, \\bm{w}_{\\phi_{ij}}]$, where $\\bm{c}_{\\phi_i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^\\ell, \\bm{w}_{\\phi_{ij}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d-\\ell}$.\nThe dimension of $\\bm{c}_{\\phi_i}$, $\\ell$, is a hyper-parameter. The unique identifier $\\bm{c}_{\\phi_i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^\\ell$ distinguishes the classes in column $i$ from those in the other columns. \n\nThe use of unique identifier is new and is particularly designed for tabular data. \nRather in language modeling, embeddings are element-wisely added with the positional encoding of the word in the sentence. Since, in tabular data, there is no ordering of the features, we do not use positional encodings. \nAn ablation study on different embedding strategies is given in Appendix \\ref{app:ablation}. The strategies include both different choices for $\\ell,d$ and element-wise adding the unique identifier and feature-value specific embeddings rather than concatenating them.\n\n\\subsubsection{Pre-training the Embeddings.}\nThe contextual embeddings explained above are learned in end-to-end supervised training using labeled examples. For a scenario, when there are a few labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples, \nwe introduce a pre-training procedure %\\citep{Devlin2019BERTPO, clark_electra_2020} \nto train the Transformer layers using unlabeled data. This is followed by fine-tuning of the pre-trained Transformer layers along with the top MLP layer using the labeled data. For fine-tuning, we use the supervised loss defined in Equation \\eqref{equaton: supervised-loss}. \n\nWe explore two different types of pre-training procedures, the masked language modeling (MLM) \\citep{Devlin2019BERTPO} and the replaced token detection (RTD) \\citep{clark_electra_2020}. Given an input $\\bm{x}_{\\text{cat}} = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_m\\}$, MLM randomly selects $k \\%$ features from index $1$ to $m$ and masks them as missing. % $\\bm{p} = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_k]$, where $p_i$ indicates column index. \nThe Transformer layers along with the column embeddings are trained by minimizing cross-entropy loss of a multi-class classifier that tries to predict the original features of the masked features, from the contextual embedding outputted from the top-layer Transformer.\n\nInstead of masking features, RTD replaces the original feature by a random value of that feature. Here, the loss is minimized for a binary classifier that tries to predict whether or not the feature has been replaced. \nThe RTD procedure as proposed in \\cite{clark_electra_2020} uses auxiliary generator for sampling a subset of features that a feature should be replaced with. The reason they used an auxiliary encoder network as the generator is that there are tens of thousands of tokens in language data and a uniformly random token is too easy to detect. In contrast, (a) the number of classes within each categorical feature is typically limited; (b) a different binary classifier is defined for each column rather than a shared one, as each column has its own embedding lookup table.\nWe name the two pre-training methods as TabTransformer-MLM and TabTransformer-RTD. In our experiments, the replacement value $k$ is set to $30$. An ablation study on $k$ is given in Appendix \\ref{app:ablation}.\n\n\\section{Experiments} \\label{sec:experiments}\n\n\\subsubsection{Data.} We evaluate TabTransformer and baseline models on $15$ publicly available binary classification datasets from the UCI repository \\citep{UCI}, the AutoML Challenge \\citep{automlchallenges}, and Kaggle \\citep{kaggle_inc_state_2017} for both supervised and semi-supervised learning. Each dataset is divided into five cross-validation splits. The  training/validation/testing proportion of the data for each split are $65/15/20\\%$. The number of categorical features across dataset ranges from $2$ to $136$. In the semi-supervised experiments, for each dataset and split, the first $p$  observations in the training data are marked as the labeled data and the remaining training data as the unlabeled set. The value of $p$ is chosen as $50$, $200$, and $500$, corresponding to $3$ different scenarios.\nIn the supervised experiments, each training dataset is fully labeled. Summary statistics of the all the datasets are provided in Table \\ref{tab:dataset_info}, \\ref{sup:tab:dataset_urls} in Appendix \\ref{sup:experiment_results}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Setup.} For the TabTransformer, the hidden (embedding) dimension, the number of layers and the number of attention heads are fixed to $32$, $6$, and $8$ respectively.  The MLP layer sizes are set to $\\{4\\times l, 2\\times l\\}$, where $l$ is the size of its input.\nFor hyperparameter optimization (HPO), each model is given $20$ HPO rounds for each cross-validation split.\nFor evaluation metrics, we use the Area under the curve (AUC) \\citep{bradley1997use}.\nNote, the pre-training is only applied in semi-supervised scenario. We do not find much benefit in using it when the entire data is labeled. Its benefit is evident when there is a large number of unlabeled examples and a few labeled examples. Since in this scenario the pre-training provides a representation of the data that could not have been learned based only on the labeled examples.\n\nThe experiment section is organized as follows. In Section \\ref{subsec: The Effectiveness}, we first demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention-based Transformer by comparing our model with the one without the Transformers (equivalently an MLP model). In Section \\ref{subsec: The Robustness}, we illustrate the robustness of TabTransformer against noisy and missing data. Finally, extensive evaluation on various methods are conducted in Section \\ref{subsec: supervised-learning} for supervised learning, and in Section \\ref{subsec: semi-supervised-learning} for semi-supervised learning.\n\n\\subsection{The Effectiveness of the Transformer Layers} \\label{subsec: The Effectiveness}\nFirst, a comparison between TabTransformers and the baseline MLP is conducted in a supervised learning scenario. We remove the Transformer layers $f_{\\bm{\\theta}}$ from the architecture, fix the rest of the components, and compare it with the original TabTransformer. The model without the attention-based Transformer layers is equivalently an MLP. The dimension of embeddings $d$ for categorical features is set as $32$ for both models. The comparison results over $15$ datasets are presented in Table \\ref{tab:ab test}. The TabTransformer with the Transformer layers outperforms the baseline MLP on $14$ out of $15$ datasets with an average $1.0\\%$ gain in AUC. %For experiment details, see Section \\ref{sec:experiments}. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Comparison between TabTransfomers and the baseline MLP.

More precisely, for each dataset we \ntake its test data, \npass their categorical features into a trained TabTransformer, and extract all contextual embeddings (across all columns) from a certain layer of the Transformer. The t-SNE algorithm is then used to reduce each embedding to a 2D point in the t-SNE plot. Figure \\ref{fig:tsne-embeddings} (left) shows the 2D visualization of embeddings from the last layer of the Transformer for dataset \\textit{bank\\_marketing}. Each marker in the plot represents an average of 2D points over the test data points for a certain class. We can see that semantically similar classes are close with each other and form clusters in the embedding space. Each cluster is annotated by a set of labels. For example, we find that all of the client-based features (color markers) such as job, education level and martial status stay close in the center and non-client based features (gray markers) such as month (last contact month of the year), day (last contact day of the week) lie outside the central area; in the bottom cluster the embedding of owning a housing loan stays close with that of being default; over the left cluster, embeddings of being a student, martial status as single, not having a housing loan, and education level as tertiary get together; and in the right cluster, education levels are closely associated with the occupation types \\citep{eduationjob}.\nIn Figure \\ref{fig:tsne-embeddings}, the center and right plots are t-SNE plots of embeddings before being passed through the Transformer and the context-free embeddings from MLP, respectively. For the embeddings before being passed into the Transformer, it starts to distinguish the non-client based features (gray markers) from the client-based features (color markers). For the embeddings from MLP, we do not observe such pattern and many categorical features which are not semantically similar are grouped together, as indicated by the annotation in the plot.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{tsne_embedding_2_submission_night.png} % Reduce the figure size so that it is slightly narrower than the column.

Since all of the experimental datasets are for binary classification, the linear model is logistic regression. \nThe motivation for this evaluation is defining the success of a simple linear model as a measure of quality for the learned embeddings.\n\nFor each dataset and each layer, an average of CV-score in AUC on the test data is computed. The evaluation is conducted on the entire test data with number of data points over 9000. Figure \\ref{fig:linear-embedding} presents results for dataset \n\\textit{BankMarketing}, \\textit{Adult}, and \\textit{QSAR\\_Bio}. For each line, each prediction score is normalized by the ``best score\" from an end-to-end trained TabTransformer for the corresponding dataset. We also explore the average and maximum pooling strategy \\citep{howard2018universal} rather than concatenation of embeddings as the features for the linear model. The upward pattern clearly shows that embeddings becomes more effective as the Transformer layer progresses. In contrast, the embeddings from MLP (the single black markers) perform worse with a linear model. Furthermore, the last value in each line close to $1.0$ indicates that a linear model with the last layer of embeddings as features can achieve reliable accuracy, which confirms our assumption. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{quant-trend-3-mlp.png} % Reduce the figure size so that it is slightly narrower than the column. Don't use precise values for figure width.This setup will avoid overfull boxes.\n\\caption{Predictions of liner models using features as the embeddings extracted from different Transformer layers in TabTransformer. Layer $0$ corresponds to the embeddings before being passed into the Transformer layers. For each dataset, each prediction score is normalized by the ``best score\" from an end-to-end trained TabTransformer.}\n\\label{fig:linear-embedding}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{The Robustness of TabTransformer} \\label{subsec: The Robustness}\n\nWe further demonstrate the robustness of TabTransformer on the noisy data and data with missing values, against the baseline MLP. We consider these two scenarios only on categorical features to specifically prove the robustness of contextual embeddings from the Transformer layers. \n\n\\subsubsection{Noisy Data.} On the test examples, we firstly contaminate the data by replacing a certain number of values by randomly generated ones from the corresponding columns (features). Next, the noisy data are passed into a trained TabTransformer to compute a prediction AUC score. Results on a set of 3 different dataets are presented in Figure \\ref{fig:contamination}. As the noisy rate increases, TabTransformer performs better in prediction accuracy and thus is more robust than MLP. In particular notice the \\emph{Blastchar} dataset where the performance is near identical with no noise, yet as the noise increases, TabTransformer becomes significantly more performant compared to the baseline.\nWe conjecture that the robustness comes from the contextual property of the embeddings. Despite a feature being noisy, it draws information from the correct features allowing for a certain amount of correction.\n\n\\subsubsection{Data with Missing Values.} Similarly, on the test data we artificially select a number of values to be missing and send the data with missing values to a trained TabTransformer to compute the prediction score. There are two options to handle the embeddings of missing values: (1) Use the average learned embeddings over all classes in the corresponding column; (2) the embedding for the class of missing value, the additional embedding for each column mentioned in Section ~\\ref{sec:TabTransformer}. Since the benchmark datasets do not contain enough missing values to effectively train the embedding in option (2), we use the average embedding in (1) for imputation. Results on the same 3 datasets are presented in Figure \\ref{fig:missing}. We can see the same patterns of the noisy data case, i.e.\\ that the TabTransformer shows better stability than MLP in handling missing values.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{corruption-plot.png} % Reduce the figure size so that it is slightly narrower than the column. Don't use precise values for figure width.This setup will avoid overfull boxes.\n\\caption{Performance of TabTransformer and MLP with noisy data.

For each dataset, each prediction score is normalized by the score of TabTransformer trained without missing values. \n}\n\\label{fig:missing}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Supervised Learning}\\label{subsec: supervised-learning}\n\nHere we compare the performance of TabTransformer against following four categories of methods: (a) Logistic regression and GBDT (b) MLP and a sparse MLP following \\cite{morcos_one_2019} (c) TabNet model of \\citet{arik2019tabnet} (d) and the Variational Information Bottleneck model (VIB) of \\citet{alemi_deep_2016}. \n\nResults are summarized in Table \\ref{tab:supervised_result}. TabTransformer, MLP, and GBDT are the top 3 performers. The TabTransformer outperforms the baseline MLP with an average 1.0\\% gain and perform comparable with the GBDT. Furthermore, the TabTransformer is significantly better than TabNet and VIB, the recent deep networks for tabular data. For experiment and model details, see Appendix \\ref{appendix:model_details}. The models' performances on each individual dataset are presented in Table \\ref{tab:supervised-result-auroc1} and \\ref{tab:supervised-result-auroc2} in Appendix \\ref{sup:experiment_results}. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Model performance in supervised learning.

Specifically, we compare our pretrained and then fine-tuned TabTransformer-RTD/MLM against following semi-supervised models: (a) Entropy Regularization (ER) \\citep{grandvalet2006entropy} combined with MLP and TabTransformer (b) Pseudo Labeling (PL) \\citep{lee2013pseudo} combined with MLP, TabTransformer, and GBDT \\citep{JainGBDTPseudolabel} (c)  MLP (DAE): an unsupervised pre-training method designed for deep models on tabular data: the swap noise Denoising AutoEncoder \\citep{jahrer_2018}. \n\nThe pre-training models TabTransformer-MLM, TabTransformer-RTD and MLP (DAE)\nare firstly pretrained on the entire unlabeled training data and then fine-tuned on labeled data. The semi-supervised learning methods, Pseudo Labeling and Entropy Regularization, are trained on the mix of labeled and unlabeled training data.\nTo better present results, we split the set of $15$ datasets into two subsets. The first set includes $6$ datasets with more than $30$K data points and the second set includes remaining $9$ datasets. \n\nThe results are presented in Table \\ref{tab:semi_supervised_result_morethan_30000} and Table \\ref{tab:semi_supervised_result_lessthan_30000}. When the number of unlabeled data is large, Table \\ref{tab:semi_supervised_result_morethan_30000} shows that our TabTransformer-RTD and TabTransformer-MLM significantly outperform all the other competitors. Particularly, TabTransformer-RTD/MLM improves over all the other competitors by at least $1.2\\%$, $2.0\\%$ and $2.1\\%$ on mean AUC for the scenario of $50$, $200$, and $500$ labeled data points respectively. The Transformer-based semi-supervised learning methods TabTransformer (ER) and TabTransformer (PL) and the tree-based semi-supervised learning method GBDT (PL) perform worse than the average of all the models. When the number of unlabeled data becomes smaller, as shown in Table \\ref{tab:semi_supervised_result_lessthan_30000}, TabTransformer-RTD still outperforms most of its competitors but with a marginal improvement.\n\nFurthermore, we observe that when the number of unlabeled data is small as shown in Table \\ref{tab:semi_supervised_result_lessthan_30000}, TabTransformer-RTD performs better than TabTransformer-MLM, thanks to its easier pre-training task (a binary classification) than that of MLM (a multi-class classification).\nThis is consistent with the finding of the ELECTRA paper \\citep{clark_electra_2020}. In Table \\ref{tab:semi_supervised_result_lessthan_30000}, with only $50$ labeled data points, MLP (ER) and MLP (PL) beat our TabTransformer-RTD/MLM. This can be attributed to the fact that there is room for improvement in our fine-tuning procedure. In particular, our approach allows to obtain informative embeddings but does not allow the weights of the classifier itself to be trained with unlabelled data. Since this issue does not occur for ER and PL, they obtain an advantage in extremely small labelled set. We point out however that this only means that the methods are complementary and mention that a possible follow up could combine the best of all approaches. %\\zk{added this explanation for why we fail on 50 points - see if it makes sense}\n\nBoth evaluation results, Table \\ref{tab:semi_supervised_result_morethan_30000} and Table \\ref{tab:semi_supervised_result_lessthan_30000}, show that our \nTabTransformer-RTD and Transformers-MLM models are promising in extracting useful information from unlabeled data to help supervised training, and are particularly useful when the size of unlabeled data is large.

In particular, \\citep{song_autoint_2019} applies one layer of multi-head attention on embeddings to learn higher order features. The higher order features are concatenated and inputted to a fully connected layer to make the final prediction. \\citep{li_interpretable_2020} use self-attention layers and track the attention scores to obtain feature importance scores. \\citep{sun_deepenfm_2019} combine the Factorization Machine model with transformer mechanism. All 3 papers are focused on recommendation systems making it hard to have a clear comparison with this paper.\nOther models have been designed around the purported properties of tabular data such as low-order and sparse feature interactions. These include Deep \\& Cross Networks \\citep{Wang2017DeepC},\nWide \\& Deep Networks \\citep{cheng2016wide}, TabNets \\citep{arik2019tabnet}, and AdaNet \\citep{cortes2016adanet}. %\\zk{Are we mentioning AdaNet anywhere?

It adds average per-sample entropy for the unlabeled examples to the original loss function for the labeled\nexamples. Another classical approach of semi-supervised learning is co-training \\citep{nigam2000analyzing}. However, the recent approaches - entropy regularization and pseudo labeling - are typically better and more popular. A succinct review of semi-supervised learning methods in general can be found in \\citep{oliver_realistic_2019, chappelle2010semi}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe proposed TabTransformer, a novel deep tabular data modeling architecture for supervised and semi-supervised learning. We provide extensive empirical evidence showing TabTransformer significantly outperforms MLP and recent deep networks for tabular data while matching the performance of tree-based ensemble models (GBDT). \nWe provide and extensively study a two-phase pre-training then fine-tune procedure for tabular data, beating the state-of-the-art performance of semi-supervised learning methods.\nTabTransformer shows promising results for robustness against noisy and missing data, and interpretability of the contextual embeddings. For future work, it would be interesting to investigate them in detail. \n\n\\newpage\n\\clearpage\n\\begin{quote}\n\\begin{small}\n\\end{small}\n\\end{quote}\n\n\\newpage\n\\clearpage\n\n\\newpage\n\\clearpage\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 2>\n\n<paper 3>\n\\title{[CancerGPT]{CancerGPT: Few-shot Drug Pair Synergy Prediction using Large Pre-trained Language Models}\n\n\\author{\\Name{Tianhao Li*}\n       \\Email{tianhao@utexas.edu}\\\\ \n       \\addr School of Information\\\\\n       University of Texas at Austin\\\\\n       Austin, Texas, USA\n       \\AND\n       \\Name{Sandesh Shetty*}\n       \\Email{sandeshshett@umass.edu}\\\\ \n       \\addr College of Information and Computer Sciences\\\\\n       University of Massachusetts Amherst\\\\\n       Amherst, MA, USA\n       \\AND\n       \\Name{Advaith Kamath}\n       \\Email{advaith.kamath@utexas.edu}\\\\ \n       \\addr Department of Chemical Engineering\\\\\n       University of Texas at Austin\\\\\n       Austin, TX, USA \n       \\AND\n       \\Name{Ajay Jaiswal}\n       \\Email{ajayjaiswal@utexas.edu}\\\\ \n       \\addr School of Information\\\\\n       University of Texas at Austin\\\\\n       Austin, TX, USA\n       \\AND\n        \\Name{Xiaoqian Jiang}\n       \\Email{xiaoqian.jiang@uth.tmc.edu}\\\\ \n       \\addr School of Biomedical Informatics\\\\\n       University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston\\\\\n       Houston, TX, USA\n       \\AND\n       \\Name{Ying Ding}\n       \\Email{ying.ding@ischool.utexas.edu}\\\\ \n       \\addr School of Information\\\\\n       University of Texas at Austin\\\\\n       Austin, TX, USA\n       \\AND\n        \\Name{Yejin Kim}\n       \\Email{yejin.kim@uth.tmc.edu}\\\\ \n       \\addr School of Biomedical Informatics\\\\\n       University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston\\\\\n       Houston, TX, USA} \n\n\n\\usepackage{lineno}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nLarge pre-trained language models (LLMs) have been shown to have significant potential in few-shot learning across various fields, even with minimal training data. However, their ability to generalize to unseen tasks in more complex fields, such as biology, has yet to be fully evaluated. LLMs can offer a promising alternative approach for biological inference, particularly in cases where structured data and sample size are limited, by extracting prior knowledge from text corpora. Our proposed few-shot learning approach uses LLMs to predict the synergy of drug pairs in rare tissues that lack structured data and features. Our experiments, which involved seven rare tissues from different cancer types, demonstrated that the LLM-based prediction model achieved significant accuracy with very few or zero samples. Our proposed model, the CancerGPT (with $\\sim$ 124M parameters), was even comparable to the larger fine-tuned GPT-3 model (with $\\sim$ 175B parameters).\nOur research is the first to tackle drug pair synergy prediction in rare tissues with limited data. We are also the first to utilize an LLM-based prediction model for biological reaction prediction tasks.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\n\n\nFoundation models have become the latest generation of artificial intelligence (AI) (\\cite{Moor2023-dp}). Instead of designing AI models that solve specific tasks one at a time, such foundation models or ``generalist'' model can be applied to many downstream tasks without specific training. For example,  large pre-trained language model (LLM), such as GPT-3 (\\cite{brown_language_2020}) and GPT-4 (\\cite{OpenAI2023-ce}), has been a game changer in foundation AI model (\\cite{Mitchell2023-cs}). LLM can apply its skills to unfamiliar tasks that it has never been trained for, which is few-shot learning or zero-shot learning. This is due in part to multitask learning, which enables LLM to unintentionally gain knowledge from implicit tasks in its training corpus (\\cite{radford_language_nodate}). Although LLM has shown its proficiency in few-shot learning in various fields (\\cite{brown_language_2020}), including natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision (\\cite{veit_learning_2017, brown_language_2020, wertheimer_few-shot_2019}), the generalizability of LLM to unseen tasks in more complex fields such as biology has yet to be fully tested. In order to infer unseen biological reactions, knowledge of participating entities (e.g., genes, cells) and underlying biological mechanisms (e.g., pathways, genetic background, cellular environment) is required. While structured databases encode only a small portion of this knowledge, the vast majority is stored in free-text literature which could be used to train LLMs. Thus, we envision that, when there are limited structured data and limited sample sizes, LLMs can serve as an innovative approach for biological prediction tasks, by extracting prior knowledge from unstructured literature. One of such few-shot biological prediction tasks with a pressing need is a drug pair synergy prediction in understudied cancer types.  \n\nDrug combination therapy has become a widely accepted strategy for treating complex diseases such as cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders. In many cases, combination therapy can provide better treatment outcomes than single-drug therapy. Predicting drug pair synergy has become an important area of research in drug discovery and development. Drug pair synergy refers to the enhancement of the therapeutic effects of two (or more) drugs when used together compared to when each drug is used alone. The prediction of drug pair synergy can be challenging due to a large number of possible combinations and the complexity of the underlying biological mechanisms (\\cite{zagidullin_drugcomb_2019}). Several computational methods have been developed to predict drug pair synergy, particularly using machine learning. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets of in vitro experiment results of drug pairs to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of synergy for a new drug pair. However, most of the data available comes from common cancer types in certain tissues, such as breast and lung cancer; very limited experiment data are available on certain types of tissues, such as bone and soft tissues (Fig. \\ref{fig:motivation}). Obtaining cell lines from these tissues can be physically difficult and expensive, which limits the number of training data available for drug pair synergy prediction. This can make it challenging to train machine learning models that rely on large datasets. \n\nEarly studies in this area have relied on relational information or contextual information to extrapolate the synergy score to cell lines in other tissues, (\\cite{chen_drugcom_2018, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa287, li_network_2018, kuru_matchmaker_2022, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac579}), ignoring the biological and cellular differences in these tissues. Another line of studies has sought to overcome the discrepancy between tissues by utilizing diverse and high-dimensional features, including genomic (e.g., gene expression of cell lines) or chemical profiles (e.g., drug structure) (\\cite{preuer_deepsynergy_2018, liu_transynergy_2021, kuru_matchmaker_2022, hosseini_ccsynergy_2023, kim_anticancer_2021}). Despite the promising results in some tissues (with abundant data), these approaches cannot be applied to tissues with too limited data to adapt its model with the large number of parameters for those high-dimensional features. \n\nIn this work, we aim to overcome the above challenge by LLMs. We hypothesize that cancer types with limited structured data and discrepant features still have good information in scientific literature.  Manually extracting predictive information on such biological entities from literature is a complex task. Our innovative approach is to leverage prior knowledge in scientific literature encoded in LLMs. We built a few-shot drug pair synergy prediction model that transforms the prediction task into a natural language inference task and generate answers based on prior knowledge encoded in LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that our LLM-based few-shot prediction model achieved significant accuracy even in zero shot setting (i.e., no training data) and outperformed strong tabular prediction models in most cases. \n\nThis remarkable few-shot prediction performance in one of the most challenging biological prediction tasks has a critical and timely implication to a broad community of biomedicine because it shows a strong promise in the ``generalist'' biomedical artificial intelligence (\\cite{Moor2023-dp}). \n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering \n  \\includegraphics[width=5in]{figures/motivation4.pdf}\n  \\caption{Few-shot prediction in biology.

Large pre-trained language model can be an innovative approach for few-shot prediction in biology thanks to its prior knowledge encoded in its weight.}\n  \\label{fig:motivation} \n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:related_works}\n\n\\subsection{Drug pair synergy prediction}\nLots of methods have been proposed to predict drug pair synergy in recent years. Based on the data type to use, these methods can be classified either as a multi-way relational method or as a context-aware method. Multi-way relational methods (\\cite{chen_drugcom_2018, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa287, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac579}) use drug and cell line's relational information without any further chemical or gene information as input and predict drug pair’s synergy. Context-aware methods (\\cite{preuer_deepsynergy_2018, liu_transynergy_2021, kuru_matchmaker_2022, hosseini_ccsynergy_2023}) further utilized chemical and gene information from drugs and cell lines to predict drug pair's synergy, which usually contains drug-drug, drug-gene, gene-gene interactions, and cellular environment. These methods usually achieve good performance with rich features on common tissues. However, both approaches do not apply to the cell lines in rare tissues with the limited size of data and cellular information. \\cite{kim_anticancer_2021} uses transfer learning to extend the prediction model trained in common tissues to some of the rare tissues with relatively rich data and cellular features. However, it cannot be utilized for rare tissues with extremely limited data and cellular information.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Few-shot learning on tabular data}\nTraditional supervised learning algorithms can struggle due to the difficulty in obtaining enough labeled data for classification. Few-shot learning is an emerging field that aims to address this issue by enabling machines to learn from a few examples rather than requiring a large size of labeled data. Meta-learning (\\cite{finn_model-agnostic_2017, Wang2023-iw, Gao2023-se}) is one technique for few-shot learning. It trains a model on a set of tasks in a way that allows it to quickly learn to solve new, unseen tasks with a few examples. Another technique is data augmentation (\\cite{nam_stunt_2023, Yang2022-ne}), which generates new examples by transforming existing data. One promising but less explored direction is to leverage LLMs, particularly when prior knowledge encoded in a corpus of text can be served as a predictive feature. TabLLM (\\cite{hegselmann_tabllm_2023}) is one such framework.  It serializes the tabular input into a natural language text and prompts LLM to generate predictions. Leveraging TabLLM, we investigated the effectiveness of LLMs in few-shot learning tasks in biology. \n\n\n\\subsection{Language models for biomolecular sequence analysis}\nThere has been a growing interest in using language models for biomolecular sequence analysis, and one approach involves the training of language models with biomolecular data (\\cite{Madani2023-sp, nvidia_bionemo}). These models learn the language of biomolecules, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, similar to how GPT-2 (\\cite{radford_language_nodate}) or GPT-3 (\\cite{brown_language_2020}) learns human language. However, our study takes a different approach. Rather than training a language model specifically for biomolecular data, we use a  language model that has been pre-trained on a corpus of human language text. This pre-trained model is used as a few-shot prediction model for drug pair synergy data, allowing us to make accurate predictions with minimal training data.  By leveraging the power of pre-trained language models, we are able to make use of existing resources and obtain generalizability to diverse biological prediction tasks beyond biomolecule sequence analysis.  \n\n\\section{Results}\n\nWe developed CancerGPT, a few-shot drug pair synergy prediction model for rare tissues. Leveraging LLMs-based tabular data prediction model (\\cite{hegselmann_tabllm_2023}), we first converted the prediction task into a natural language inference task and generated answer using prior knowledge from the scientific literature encoded in LLM's pre-trained weight matrices (Section \\ref{sec:llm-prediction-model}, Fig. \\ref{fig:study_workflow}). We presented our strategy to adapt the LLM to our task with only a few shots of training data in each rare tissue in Section \\ref{sec:k_shot} and Fig. \\ref{fig:models}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering \n  \\includegraphics[width=7in]{figures/FigureO.pdf}\n  \\caption{Study workflow. We first converted the tabular input to natural text and created a task-specific prompt (Section \\ref{sec:convert}). The prompt was designed to generate binary class predictions (e.g., \\emph{``Positive'', ``Not positive''}). We fine-tuned the LLMs (GPT-2 and GPT-3) with $k$-shots of data in rare tissues (Section \\ref{sec:k_shot}). We further tailored GPT-2 by fine-tuning it with a large amount of common tissue data, in order to adjust GPT-2 in the context of drug pair synergy prediction (CancerGPT, Section \\ref{sec:cancergpt2}). We evaluated and compared the prediction models with a different number of shots and tissues (Section \\ref{sec:experiments}). We investigated the LLM's reasoning based on factual evidence.}  \n  \\label{fig:study_workflow} \n\\end{figure}\n\nTo evaluate the performance of our proposed CancerGPT model and other LLM-based models, we conduct a series of experiments in which we compare the model with various other tabular models (Section \\ref{sec:experiments}). We measured accuracy using the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) under the different settings. We considered different few-shot learning scenarios, where the model is provided with a limited number $k$ of training data to learn from ($k$=0 to 128). By varying the number of shots, we can examine the model's ability to adapt and generalize with minimal training data. \nNext, we investigated the performance of CancerGPT and other LLM-based models across different tissue types. Since cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with various subtypes, it is crucial for the model to be able to accurately predict outcomes in diverse tissue contexts. We then investigated whether the LLM's reasoning for its prediction is valid by checking its argument with scientific literature. \n\n\\subsection{Accuracy}\n\n\\begin{adjustwidth}{-2.5cm}{-2.5cm}\\centering\\begin{threeparttable}[!htb]\n\\scriptsize\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrrrrrr}\\toprule\n& &\\multicolumn{8}{c}{Number of shots} \\\\\\cmidrule{3-10}\n&Methods &0 &2 &4 &8 &16 &32 &64 &128 \\\\\\midrule\n\\multirowcell{5}{Pancreas \\\\ ($n_0$=38, $n_1$=1)} &XGBoost &0.026 &- &- &- &- &- &- &- \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.056 &- &- &- &- &- &- &- \\\\\n&CancerGPT &0.033 &- &- &- &- &- &- &- \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.032 &- &- &- &- &- &- &- \\\\\n&GPT-3 &\\textbf{0.111} &- &- &- &- &- &- &- \\\\\n& & & & & & & & & \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Endometrium \\\\ ($n_0$=36, $n_1$=32)} &XGBoost &0.5 &0.5 &0.5 &0.5 &0.5 &0.5 &- &- \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.674 &0.889 &0.903 &\\textbf{0.948} &\\textbf{0.938} &\\textbf{0.962} &- &- \\\\\n&CancerGPT &0.564 &0.668 &0.676 &0.831 &0.686 &0.737 &- &- \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.408 &0.808 &0.395 &0.383 &0.389 &0.717 &- &- \\\\\n&GPT-3 &\\textbf{0.869} &\\textbf{1} &\\textbf{0.947} &0.859 &0.799 &0.859 &- &- \\\\ \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Liver \\\\ ($n_0$=192, $n_1$=21)} &XGBoost &0.132 &0.132 &0.132 &0.132 &0.132 &0.132 &0.12 &0.12 \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.13 &\\textbf{0.128} &0.147 &0.189 &0.265 &0.168 &0.169 &0.234 \\\\\n&CancerGPT &0.136 &0.102 &0.13 &0.147 &0.252 &0.21 &0.197 &0.187 \\\\\n&GPT-2 &\\textbf{0.5} &0.099 &\\textbf{0.151} &\\textbf{0.383} &\\textbf{0.429} &\\textbf{0.401} &\\textbf{0.483} &0.398 \\\\\n&GPT-3 &0.185 &0.086 &0.096 &0.125 &0.124 &0.314 &0.362 &\\textbf{0.519} \\\\ \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Soft tissue \\\\ ($n_0$=269, $n_1$=83)} &XGBoost &0.243 &0.243 &0.243 &0.243 &0.235 &0.235 &0.264 &0.271 \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.273 &0.287 &\\textbf{0.462} &\\textbf{0.422} &\\textbf{0.526} &0.571 &0.561 &0.64 \\\\\n&CancerGPT &\\textbf{0.314} &\\textbf{0.315} &0.338 &0.383 &0.383 &0.403 &0.464 &0.469 \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.259 &0.298 &0.254 &0.262 &0.235 &0.297 &0.254 &0.206 \\\\\n&GPT-3 &0.263 &0.194 &0.28 &0.228 &0.363 &\\textbf{0.618} &\\textbf{0.638} &\\textbf{0.734} \\\\ \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Stomach \\\\ ($n_0$=1081, $n_1$=109)} &XGBoost &0.104 &0.104 &0.104 &0.104 &0.104 &0.104 &0.09 &0.094 \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.261 &\\textbf{0.371} &\\textbf{0.396} &\\textbf{0.383} &\\textbf{0.294} &\\textbf{0.402} &\\textbf{0.45} &\\textbf{0.465} \\\\\n&CancerGPT &\\textbf{0.3} &0.297 &0.316 &0.325 &0.269 &0.308 &0.297 &0.312 \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.116 &0.124 &0.099 &0.172 &0.165 &0.107 &0.152 &0.131 \\\\\n&GPT-3 &0.078 &0.106 &0.17 &0.37 &0.1 &0.19 &0.219 &0.181 \\\\ \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Urinary tract \\\\ ($n_0$=1996, $n_1$=462)} &XGBoost &0.186 &0.186 &0.186 &0.186 &0.186 &0.197 &0.199 &0.209 \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.248 &\\textbf{0.264} &\\textbf{0.25} &\\textbf{0.278} &\\textbf{0.274} &0.249 &\\textbf{0.293} &\\textbf{0.291} \\\\\n&CancerGPT &0.241 &0.226 &0.246 &0.239 &0.256 &\\textbf{0.271} &0.266 &0.269 \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.191 &0.192 &0.188 &0.156 &0.193 &0.185 &0.183 &0.185 \\\\\n&GPT-3 &\\textbf{0.27} &0.228 &0.222 &0.201 &0.206 &0.2 &0.24 &0.272 \\\\ \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Bone \\\\ ($n_0$=3732, $n_1$=253)} &XGBoost &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 \\\\\n&TabTransformer &\\textbf{0.123} &0.12 &0.121 &0.115 &0.102 &\\textbf{0.13} &\\textbf{0.129} &0.121 \\\\\n&CancerGPT &0.119 &\\textbf{0.115} &\\textbf{0.125} &\\textbf{0.116} &\\textbf{0.115} &0.11 &0.114 &0.125 \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.063 &0.094 &0.057 &0.081 &0.052 &0.071 &0.057 &0.065 \\\\\n&GPT-3 &0.064 &0.051 &0.045 &0.058 &0.068 &0.087 &0.101 &\\textbf{0.181} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{AUPRC of $k$-shot learning on seven tissue sets. $n_0$:=total number of non-synergistic samples (not positive), $n_1$:=total number of synergistic samples (positive).

We calculated the AUPRC and AUROC of the LLM-based models (CancerGPT, GPT-2, GPT-3) and baseline models (XGBoost, TabTransformer) (Table \\ref{tab:auprc}, \\ref{tab:auroc}). Due to an imbalance in positive and non-positive labels, we reported both AUPRC and AUROC. Details on the classification task and threshold of synergy are discussed in Section \\ref{sec:hyperparameter}. \n\n\\paragraph{Number of training data and accuracy}\n\nOverall, the LLM-based models (CancerGPT, GPT-2, GPT-3) achieved comparable or better accuracy in most of the cases compared to baselines. In the zero-shot scenario, the LLM-based models generally had higher accuracy than the baseline models in all experiments except stomach and bone. As the number of shots increased, we observed mixed patterns across various tissues and models. TabTransformer consistently exhibited an increase in accuracy with more shots. CancerGPT showed higher accuracy with more shots in the endometrium and soft tissue, and GPT-3 showed higher accuracy with more shots in the liver, soft tissues, and bone, indicating that the information gained from a few shots of data complements the prior knowledge encoded in CancerGPT and GPT-3. \n\nHowever, the LLM-based models sometimes did not show significant improvements in accuracy in certain tissues, such as the stomach and urinary tract, suggesting that the additional training data do not always improve the LLM-based models' performance. \nWith the maximum number of shots ($k$=128), the LLM-based model, specifically GPT-3, was on par with TabTransformer, achieving the highest accuracy with the pancreas, liver, soft tissue, and bone, while TabTransformer achieved the best accuracy with endometrium, stomach, and urinary tract.\n\n\\paragraph{Tissue types and accuracy}\nThe accuracy of the models varied depending on the tissue types, as each tissue possessed unique characteristics and had different data size. In pancreas and endometrium tissues, GPT-3 showed high accuracy with only a few shots ($k$=0 or 2). Generally, the cell lines from the two tissues are difficult to obtain and have a limited number of well-established cell lines, which makes them less investigated. For example, the pancreas is located deep within the abdomen, making it difficult to access and isolate cells without damaging them. The endometrium is a complex tissue that undergoes cyclic changes during the menstrual cycle, and this dynamic process complicates the cell culturing process. Due to this limited training data, few-shot drug pair synergy prediction in these tissues required even higher generalizability.\n\nIn the liver, soft tissue, and bone, GPT-3 again achieved the highest accuracy than any other models, including one that trained with common tissues (TabTransformer, CancerGPT). This may be because these tissues have unique cellular characteristics specific to their tissue of origin that training with common tissues may not help predict accurately. For example, hepatic cell lines (originated from liver tissue) are often used in research on drug metabolism and toxicity and have unique drug response characteristics due to high expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (\\cite{guo_similarities_2011}). Bone cell lines have bone-specific signaling pathways that can affect drug responses, and the extracellular matrix composition and structure in bone tissue can also impact drug delivery and efficacy (\\cite{lin_bone_2020}). \n\nOn the other hand, models trained with common tissues (TabTransformer, CancerGPT) achieved the best accuracy in the stomach and urinary tract tissues of all $k$, indicating that the prediction learned from common tissues can be extrapolated to these tissues. Particularly, CancerGPT achieved the highest accuracy with no training sample ($k$=0) in the stomach.  \n\n\\paragraph{Comparing LLM-based models}\nWhen comparing LLM-based models, CancerGPT and GPT-3 demonstrated superior accuracy compared to GPT-2 in most tissues. GPT-3 exhibited higher accuracy than CancerGPT in tissues with limited data or unique characteristics, while CancerGPT performed better than GPT-3 in tissues with less distinctive characteristics, such as the stomach and urinary tract. The higher accuracy of CancerGPT compared to GPT-2 highlights that well-balanced adjustment to specific tasks can increase the accuracy while maintaining generalizability. However, the benefits of such adjustments may diminish with larger LLM models, such as GPT-3 (175B parameters), in situations where more generalizability is required.  The fact that CancerGPT with smaller parameters (124M parameters) achieved the comparable accuracy to GPT-3 with larger parameters (175B parameters) implies that further fine-tuning of GPT-3 could achieve even higher accuracy. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Fact check LLM's reasoning}\nWe evaluated whether the LLM can provide the biological reasoning behind its prediction. In this experiment, we used zero-shot GPT-3 because other fine-tuned LLM-based models compromised its language generative performance during the fine-tuning and were not able to provide coherent responses. To do this, we randomly selected one true positive prediction and examined whether its biological rationale was based on factual evidence or mere hallucination. Our example was the drug pair AZD4877 and AZD1208 at cell line T24 for urinary tract tissue. We prompted the LLMs with \\emph{``Could you provide details why are the drug1 and drug2 synergistic in the cell line for a given cancer type?’’}. Details on prompt generation are discussed in Supplementary 1.  We evaluated the generated answer by comparing it with existing scientific literature. We found that the LLM provided mostly accurate arguments, except for two cases (Table \\ref{tab:reasoning}) in which no scientific literature exists. By combining these individual scientific facts the LLM inferred the unseen synergistic effect. Generally, drugs targeting non-overlapping proteins in similar pathways are more likely to be synergistic (\\cite{Cheng2019-dp, Tang2022-wn}).  In  this case, both AZD4877 and AZD1208 target similar pathways that inhibit tumor cell divisions without overlapping protein targets. The Loewe synergy score of this pair at T24 was 46.82, meaning strong positive synergistic effect.\n\n\n\\begin{table}[!htp]\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{3in}|p{3in}|}\\toprule\nExcerpt of the generated answer & Fact check and reference \\\\ \\hline\n\\emph{``The combination of AZD-4877 and AZD1208 has been studied in T24 cells...to be synergistic in reducing bladder cancer cell growth and metastasis''} &False.

We randomly selected two true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative prediction examples.\nWe discovered that Loewe synergy scores of the true negative or false negative prediction examples were close to the threshold we used to categorize the label (i.e., Loewe score $>$5). This suggests that accuracy may vary significantly by different thresholds for determining positive synergy. Setting more extreme thresholds (e.g., $>$10, $>$30), like previous models (\\cite{kim_anticancer_2021}, \\cite{kuru_matchmaker_2022}, \\cite{hosseini_ccsynergy_2023}), may increase the prediction accuracy. \n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion} \n\n\\paragraph{Summary}\nOur study investigates the potential of LLMs as a widely applicable few-shot prediction model in the field of biology. Specifically, we propose a new few-shot model for predicting drug pair synergy, which can be used in rare tissues with few or no training samples available. We transformed tabular data prediction into natural language inference tasks and fine-tuned LLMs (GPT-2, GPT-3) with very few samples in each tissue. The CancerGPT model, which was further tuned with a large amount of common tissue data, showed comparable accuracy to the few-shot tuned GPT-3 model, indicating that tailoring GPT-3 to specific tasks could further improve prediction accuracy. The LLM's reasoning for its prediction revealed that it implicitly infers unseen synergistic effects by combining several independent scientific facts. \n\n\\paragraph{Why drug pair synergy prediction to evaluate LLMs}\nThe prediction of drug pair synergy in uncommon tissues serves as an excellent benchmark task for evaluating LLMs in few-shot learning within the field of biology. This prediction requires incorporating multiple pieces of information, such as drug and cell line, as well as the sensitivity of drugs to the cell lines, in order to infer the synergistic effects. While detailed information on these entities can be found in scientific papers, the interaction effect, or synergistic effect, is primarily available through biological experiments. To effectively assess LLMs' inference capabilities, one must employ a prediction task where the ground truth is not explicitly available in text format but can be determined through alternative sources for model evaluation. Typically, drug pair synergy scores are obtained through high-throughput testing facilities involving robot arms (\\cite{he_methods_2018}). Therefore, individual records of the experiments are seldom recorded in academic literature, decreasing the likelihood of their use as training data for LLMs. Additionally, few studies have been conducted on rare tissues regarding their synergy prediction models, and their synergy prediction outcomes are not explicitly stated in text format. Another similar task is predicting the sensitivity of a single drug in a cell line; however, since the sensitivity of individual drugs is extensively researched and well-documented in publications, the LLM model may merely recollect from the text rather than infer unseen tasks.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Comparison to existing drug pair synergy prediction models}\nIt should be noted that it was not possible to compare our LLM-based models with previous predictions of drug pair synergy. The majority of models necessitate high-dimensional features of drugs and cells (e.g., genomic or chemical profiles), along with a substantial amount of training data, even the one specifically designed for rare tissue (\\cite{kim_anticancer_2021}). This kind of data is not easily accessible in rare tissues, which makes it challenging to carry out a significant comparison. Our model is designed to address a common but often overlooked situation where we have limited features and data. Thus, we compared the LLM-based models with other tabular models that share the same set of inputs.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Contribution}\nThe contribution of our study can be summarized as follows. In the area of drug pair synergy prediction in rare tissues, our study is the first to predict drug pair synergy on tissues with very limited data and features, which other previous prediction models have neglected. This breakthrough in drug pair synergy prediction could have significant implications for drug development in these cancer types. By accurately predicting which drug pair will have a synergistic effect on these tissues in which cell lines are expensive to obtain, biologists can directly zoom into the most probable drug pairs and perform in vitro experiments in a cost effective manner. \n\nOur study also delivers generalizable insights about LLMs in the broader context of  biology. To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first to investigate the use of LLMs as an few-shot inference tool based on prior knowledge in the field of biology, where much of the latest information is presented in unstructured free text (such as scientific literature). This innovative approach could have significant implications for advancing computational biology where obtaining abundant training data is not readily possible. By leveraging the vast amounts of unstructured data available in the field, LLMs can help researchers bypassing the challenge of limited training data when building data-driven computational models. \n\nFurthermore, this LLM-based few-shot prediction approach could be applied to a wide range of diseases beyond cancer, which is currently limited by the scarcity of available data. For instance, this approach could be used in infectious diseases, where the prompt identification of new treatments and diagnostic tools is crucial. LLMs could help researchers quickly identify potential drug targets and biomarkers for these diseases, resulting in faster and more effective treatment development. \n\n\n\\paragraph{Limitations}\nThe present study, while aiming to showcase the potential of LLMs as a few-shot prediction model in the field of biology, is not without its limitations. To fully establish the generalizability of LLMs as a ``generalist'' artificial intelligence, a wider range of biological prediction tasks must be undertaken to validate it. Additionally, it is crucial to investigate how the information gleaned from LLMs complements the existing genomic or chemical features that have traditionally been the primary source of predictive information. In future research, we plan to delve deeper into this aspect and develop an ensemble method that effectively utilizes both existing structured features and new prior knowledge encoded in LLMs. \n\nFurthermore, while we observed that GPT-3's reasoning was similar to our own when fact-checking its argument with scientific literature in one example, it is important to note that the accuracy of its arguments cannot always be verified and may be susceptible to hallucination. It is reported that LLMs can also contain biases that humans have (\\cite{Schramowski2022-yg}). Therefore, further research is necessary to ensure that the LLM's reasoning is grounded in factual evidence. Despite these limitations, our study provides valuable insights into the potential of LLMs as a few-shot prediction model in biology and lays the groundwork for future research in this area.\n\n\n\\section{Method}\n\n\\subsection{Problem Formulation}\n\n\\paragraph{Objective}\nOur objective is to predict whether a drug pair in a certain cell line has a synergistic effect, particularly focusing on rare tissues with limited training samples. Given an input $$x = \\{d_1, d_2, c, t, ri_1, ri_2 \\}$$ of drug pair $(d_1, d_2)$, cell line $c$, tissue $t$, and the sensitivity of the two drugs using relative inhibition, the prediction model is $$y \\approx f(x) $$ where $y$ is the binary synergy class (1 if positive synergy; 0 otherwise).  Prior research (\\cite{10.1093/bioinformatics/btac579, hosseini_ccsynergy_2023}) has employed three different scenarios for predicting drug pair synergy (random split, stratified by cell lines, stratified by drug combinations). Our task is to predict synergy when the data are stratified by tissue, which is a subset of cell lines.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Why tabular input}\nAs discussed in Section \\ref{sec:related_works}, relationships learned in a tissue cannot be well generalizable to other tissues that have different cellular environments. This biological difference poses a challenge in predicting drug pair’s synergy in tissues with a limited number of samples. The limited sample size makes it even more difficult to incorporate typical cell line features, such as gene expression level, which has large dimensionality (e.g., $\\sim$ 20,000 genes). Due to this data challenge, the drug pair synergy prediction model is then reduced to build a prediction model with limited samples (few or zero-shot learning) with only limited tabular input feature types. Specific input features were described in Section \\ref{sec:experiments}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Synergy prediction models based on Large pre-trained language models}\n\\label{sec:convert}\n\n\\paragraph{Converting tabular input to natural text}\nTo use an LLM for tabular data, the tabular input and prediction task must be transformed into a natural text. For each instance of tabular data (Fig. \\ref{fig:study_workflow}), we converted the structured features into text. For example, given the feature string (e.g., ``drug1'', ``drug 2'', ``cell line'', ``tissue'', ``sensitivity1'', ``sensitivity2'') and its value (e.g., ``lonidamine'', ``717906-29-1'', ``A-673'', ``bone'', ``0.568'', ``28.871''), we converted the instance as \\emph{``The first drug is AZD1775. The second drug is AZACITIDINE. The cell line is SF-295. Tissue is bone. The first drug's sensitivity using relative inhibition is 0.568. The second drug's sensitivity using relative inhibition is 28.871.''} Other alternative ways to convert the tabular instance into the natural text are discussed in previous papers (\\cite{li_deep_2020, narayan_can_2022}).\n\n\\paragraph{Converting prediction task into natural text}\nWe created a prompt that specifies our tasks and guides the LLM to generate a label of our interest. We experimented with multiple prompts. One example of the prompts we created was \\emph{``Determine cancer drug combination synergy for the following drugs. Allowed synergies: {{Positive, Not positive}}. {{ Tabular Input }}. Synergy:''}. As our task is a binary classification, we created the prompt to only generate binary answers (\\emph{``Positive'', ``Not positive''}).  Comparing these multiple prompts (Supplementary 1), the final prompt we used in this work was \\emph{``Decide in a single word if the synergy of the drug combination in the cell line is positive or not. \\{\\{ Tabular Input \\}\\}. Synergy:''.}\n\n\\subsection{LLM-based prediction model}\n\\label{sec:llm-prediction-model}\n\\paragraph{Large pre-trained language models}\n\nWe built our prediction models by tuning GPT-2 and GPT-3 into our tasks (Fig. \\ref{fig:study_workflow}).  GPT-2 is a Transformer-based large language model which was pre-trained on a very large corpus of English data without human supervision. It achieved state-of-the-art results on several language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting when it was released, and it is the predecessor of GPT-3 and GPT-4. GPT-2 (\\cite{radford_language_nodate}) has several versions with different sizes of parameters, GPT-2, GPT-Medium, GPT-Large, and GPT-XL. We used GPT-2 with the smallest number of parameters (regular GPT-2, 124 million) in this work to make the model trainable on our server. To adjust the model for a binary classification task, we added a linear layer as a sequence classification head on top of GPT-2, which uses the last token of the output of GPT-2 to classify the input. The cross-entropy loss was used to optimize the model during the fine-tuning process (discussed below). \n\n GPT-3 (\\cite{brown_language_2020}) is a Transformer-based autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, which achieved state-of-the-art performance on many zero-shot and few-shot tasks when it was released. GPT-3.5, including ChatGPT (\\cite{openai_chatgpt}), a famous fine-tuned model from GPT-3.5, is an improved version of GPT-3. However, the GPT-3 model and its parameters are not publicly available.  Although the weight of the GPT-3 model is undisclosed, OpenAI offers an API (\\cite{openai_finetuning}) to fine-tune the model and evaluate its performance. We utilized this API to build drug pair synergy prediction models through $k$-shot fine-tuning. There are four models provided by OpenAI for fine-tuning, Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada, of which Ada is the fastest model and has comparable performance with larger models for classification tasks. For that reason, we use GPT-3 Ada as our classification model. After uploading the train data, the API adjusted the learning rate, which is 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 multiplied by the original learning rate based on the size of the data, and fine-tuned the model for four epochs. A model of the last epoch was provided for further evaluation. \n\n\n \\subsection{CancerGPT}\n \\label{sec:cancergpt2}\n We further tailored GPT-2 by fine-tuning it with a large amount of common tissue data, in order to adjust GPT-2 in the context of drug pair synergy prediction. We named this model CancerGPT. CancerGPT used the same structure as the modified GPT-2 mentioned above. A linear layer was added to the top of GPT-2, which uses the last token of the GPT-2 output to predict the label. To use the pre-trained GPT-2 model, the same tokenizer was used as GPT-2. Left padding was used to ensure the last token was from the prompt sentence. The cross-entropy loss was used to optimize the model.  \n\nCancerGPT was first fine-tuned to learn the relational information between drug pairs from common tissues, similar to collaborative filtering (\\cite{10.1093/bioinformatics/bty452}) (Fig. \\ref{fig:models}). This approach was based on the assumption that certain drug pairs exhibit synergy regardless of the cellular context, and therefore, the relational information between drug pairs in common tissues can be used to predict synergy in new cell lines in different tissues (\\cite{hosseini_ccsynergy_2023}). Additionally, we incorporated information on the sensitivity of each individual drug to the given cell line, using relative inhibition score as a measure of sensitivity (\\cite{10.1093/nar/gkab438}). By doing so, we were able to gather a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the relationship between drugs and cell lines.\n\nSubsequently, we utilized CancerGPT as one of the pre-trained LLMs and fine-tuned to $k$ shots of data in each rare tissue (as discussed in the following section). All the LLM models use the tabular input that was converted to natural text and share the same prompt.\n\n\\subsection{$k$-shot fine-tuning strategy}\n\\label{sec:k_shot}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering \n  \\includegraphics[width=6in]}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nLarge pre-trained language models (LLMs) have been shown to have significant potential in few-shot learning across various fields, even with minimal training data. However, their ability to generalize to unseen tasks in more complex fields, such as biology, has yet to be fully evaluated. LLMs can offer a promising alternative approach for biological inference, particularly in cases where structured data and sample size are limited, by extracting prior knowledge from text corpora. Our proposed few-shot learning approach uses LLMs to predict the synergy of drug pairs in rare tissues that lack structured data and features. Our experiments, which involved seven rare tissues from different cancer types, demonstrated that the LLM-based prediction model achieved significant accuracy with very few or zero samples. Our proposed model, the CancerGPT (with $\\sim$ 124M parameters), was even comparable to the larger fine-tuned GPT-3 model (with $\\sim$ 175B parameters).\nOur research is the first to tackle drug pair synergy prediction in rare tissues with limited data. We are also the first to utilize an LLM-based prediction model for biological reaction prediction tasks.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nFoundation models have become the latest generation of artificial intelligence (AI) (\\cite{Moor2023-dp}). Instead of designing AI models that solve specific tasks one at a time, such foundation models or ``generalist'' model can be applied to many downstream tasks without specific training. For example,  large pre-trained language model (LLM), such as GPT-3 (\\cite{brown_language_2020}) and GPT-4 (\\cite{OpenAI2023-ce}), has been a game changer in foundation AI model (\\cite{Mitchell2023-cs}). LLM can apply its skills to unfamiliar tasks that it has never been trained for, which is few-shot learning or zero-shot learning. This is due in part to multitask learning, which enables LLM to unintentionally gain knowledge from implicit tasks in its training corpus (\\cite{radford_language_nodate}). Although LLM has shown its proficiency in few-shot learning in various fields (\\cite{brown_language_2020}), including natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision (\\cite{veit_learning_2017, brown_language_2020, wertheimer_few-shot_2019}), the generalizability of LLM to unseen tasks in more complex fields such as biology has yet to be fully tested. In order to infer unseen biological reactions, knowledge of participating entities (e.g., genes, cells) and underlying biological mechanisms (e.g., pathways, genetic background, cellular environment) is required. While structured databases encode only a small portion of this knowledge, the vast majority is stored in free-text literature which could be used to train LLMs. Thus, we envision that, when there are limited structured data and limited sample sizes, LLMs can serve as an innovative approach for biological prediction tasks, by extracting prior knowledge from unstructured literature. One of such few-shot biological prediction tasks with a pressing need is a drug pair synergy prediction in understudied cancer types.  \n\nDrug combination therapy has become a widely accepted strategy for treating complex diseases such as cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders. In many cases, combination therapy can provide better treatment outcomes than single-drug therapy. Predicting drug pair synergy has become an important area of research in drug discovery and development. Drug pair synergy refers to the enhancement of the therapeutic effects of two (or more) drugs when used together compared to when each drug is used alone. The prediction of drug pair synergy can be challenging due to a large number of possible combinations and the complexity of the underlying biological mechanisms (\\cite{zagidullin_drugcomb_2019}). Several computational methods have been developed to predict drug pair synergy, particularly using machine learning. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets of in vitro experiment results of drug pairs to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of synergy for a new drug pair. However, most of the data available comes from common cancer types in certain tissues, such as breast and lung cancer; very limited experiment data are available on certain types of tissues, such as bone and soft tissues (Fig. \\ref{fig:motivation}). Obtaining cell lines from these tissues can be physically difficult and expensive, which limits the number of training data available for drug pair synergy prediction. This can make it challenging to train machine learning models that rely on large datasets. \n\nEarly studies in this area have relied on relational information or contextual information to extrapolate the synergy score to cell lines in other tissues, (\\cite{chen_drugcom_2018, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa287, li_network_2018, kuru_matchmaker_2022, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac579}), ignoring the biological and cellular differences in these tissues. Another line of studies has sought to overcome the discrepancy between tissues by utilizing diverse and high-dimensional features, including genomic (e.g., gene expression of cell lines) or chemical profiles (e.g., drug structure) (\\cite{preuer_deepsynergy_2018, liu_transynergy_2021, kuru_matchmaker_2022, hosseini_ccsynergy_2023, kim_anticancer_2021}). Despite the promising results in some tissues (with abundant data), these approaches cannot be applied to tissues with too limited data to adapt its model with the large number of parameters for those high-dimensional features. \n\nIn this work, we aim to overcome the above challenge by LLMs. We hypothesize that cancer types with limited structured data and discrepant features still have good information in scientific literature.  Manually extracting predictive information on such biological entities from literature is a complex task. Our innovative approach is to leverage prior knowledge in scientific literature encoded in LLMs. We built a few-shot drug pair synergy prediction model that transforms the prediction task into a natural language inference task and generate answers based on prior knowledge encoded in LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that our LLM-based few-shot prediction model achieved significant accuracy even in zero shot setting (i.e., no training data) and outperformed strong tabular prediction models in most cases. \n\nThis remarkable few-shot prediction performance in one of the most challenging biological prediction tasks has a critical and timely implication to a broad community of biomedicine because it shows a strong promise in the ``generalist'' biomedical artificial intelligence (\\cite{Moor2023-dp}). \n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering \n  \\includegraphics[width=5in]{figures/motivation4.pdf}\n  \\caption{Few-shot prediction in biology. A. Different from task-specific approach, large pre-trained language model can perform new tasks which are not been explicitly trained for. B. Drug pair synergy prediction in rare tissues is an important examples of numerous few-shot prediction tasks in biology. C. Large pre-trained language model can be an innovative approach for few-shot prediction in biology thanks to its prior knowledge encoded in its weight.}\n  \\label{fig:motivation} \n\\end{figure} \n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:related_works}\n\n\\subsection{Drug pair synergy prediction}\nLots of methods have been proposed to predict drug pair synergy in recent years. Based on the data type to use, these methods can be classified either as a multi-way relational method or as a context-aware method. Multi-way relational methods (\\cite{chen_drugcom_2018, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa287, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac579}) use drug and cell line's relational information without any further chemical or gene information as input and predict drug pair’s synergy. Context-aware methods (\\cite{preuer_deepsynergy_2018, liu_transynergy_2021, kuru_matchmaker_2022, hosseini_ccsynergy_2023}) further utilized chemical and gene information from drugs and cell lines to predict drug pair's synergy, which usually contains drug-drug, drug-gene, gene-gene interactions, and cellular environment. These methods usually achieve good performance with rich features on common tissues. However, both approaches do not apply to the cell lines in rare tissues with the limited size of data and cellular information. \\cite{kim_anticancer_2021} uses transfer learning to extend the prediction model trained in common tissues to some of the rare tissues with relatively rich data and cellular features. However, it cannot be utilized for rare tissues with extremely limited data and cellular information.\n\n\\subsection{Few-shot learning on tabular data}\nTraditional supervised learning algorithms can struggle due to the difficulty in obtaining enough labeled data for classification. Few-shot learning is an emerging field that aims to address this issue by enabling machines to learn from a few examples rather than requiring a large size of labeled data. Meta-learning (\\cite{finn_model-agnostic_2017, Wang2023-iw, Gao2023-se}) is one technique for few-shot learning. It trains a model on a set of tasks in a way that allows it to quickly learn to solve new, unseen tasks with a few examples. Another technique is data augmentation (\\cite{nam_stunt_2023, Yang2022-ne}), which generates new examples by transforming existing data. One promising but less explored direction is to leverage LLMs, particularly when prior knowledge encoded in a corpus of text can be served as a predictive feature. TabLLM (\\cite{hegselmann_tabllm_2023}) is one such framework.  It serializes the tabular input into a natural language text and prompts LLM to generate predictions. Leveraging TabLLM, we investigated the effectiveness of LLMs in few-shot learning tasks in biology. \n\n\\subsection{Language models for biomolecular sequence analysis}\nThere has been a growing interest in using language models for biomolecular sequence analysis, and one approach involves the training of language models with biomolecular data (\\cite{Madani2023-sp, nvidia_bionemo}). These models learn the language of biomolecules, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, similar to how GPT-2 (\\cite{radford_language_nodate}) or GPT-3 (\\cite{brown_language_2020}) learns human language. However, our study takes a different approach. Rather than training a language model specifically for biomolecular data, we use a  language model that has been pre-trained on a corpus of human language text. This pre-trained model is used as a few-shot prediction model for drug pair synergy data, allowing us to make accurate predictions with minimal training data.  By leveraging the power of pre-trained language models, we are able to make use of existing resources and obtain generalizability to diverse biological prediction tasks beyond biomolecule sequence analysis.  \n\n\\section{Results}\n\nWe developed CancerGPT, a few-shot drug pair synergy prediction model for rare tissues. Leveraging LLMs-based tabular data prediction model (\\cite{hegselmann_tabllm_2023}), we first converted the prediction task into a natural language inference task and generated answer using prior knowledge from the scientific literature encoded in LLM's pre-trained weight matrices (Section \\ref{sec:llm-prediction-model}, Fig. \\ref{fig:study_workflow}). We presented our strategy to adapt the LLM to our task with only a few shots of training data in each rare tissue in Section \\ref{sec:k_shot} and Fig. \\ref{fig:models}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering \n  \\includegraphics[width=7in]{figures/FigureO.pdf}\n  \\caption{Study workflow. We first converted the tabular input to natural text and created a task-specific prompt (Section \\ref{sec:convert}). The prompt was designed to generate binary class predictions (e.g., \\emph{``Positive'', ``Not positive''}). We fine-tuned the LLMs (GPT-2 and GPT-3) with $k$-shots of data in rare tissues (Section \\ref{sec:k_shot}). We further tailored GPT-2 by fine-tuning it with a large amount of common tissue data, in order to adjust GPT-2 in the context of drug pair synergy prediction (CancerGPT, Section \\ref{sec:cancergpt2}). We evaluated and compared the prediction models with a different number of shots and tissues (Section \\ref{sec:experiments}). We investigated the LLM's reasoning based on factual evidence.}  \n  \\label{fig:study_workflow} \n\\end{figure}\n\nTo evaluate the performance of our proposed CancerGPT model and other LLM-based models, we conduct a series of experiments in which we compare the model with various other tabular models (Section \\ref{sec:experiments}). We measured accuracy using the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) under the different settings. We considered different few-shot learning scenarios, where the model is provided with a limited number $k$ of training data to learn from ($k$=0 to 128). By varying the number of shots, we can examine the model's ability to adapt and generalize with minimal training data. \nNext, we investigated the performance of CancerGPT and other LLM-based models across different tissue types. Since cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with various subtypes, it is crucial for the model to be able to accurately predict outcomes in diverse tissue contexts. We then investigated whether the LLM's reasoning for its prediction is valid by checking its argument with scientific literature. \n\n\\subsection{Accuracy}\n\n\\begin{adjustwidth}{-2.5cm}{-2.5cm}\\centering\\begin{threeparttable}[!htb]\n\\scriptsize\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrrrrrr}\\toprule\n& &\\multicolumn{8}{c}{Number of shots} \\\\\\cmidrule{3-10}\n&Methods &0 &2 &4 &8 &16 &32 &64 &128 \\\\\\midrule\n\\multirowcell{5}{Pancreas \\\\ ($n_0$=38, $n_1$=1)} &XGBoost &0.026 &- &- &- &- &- &- &- \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.056 &- &- &- &- &- &- &- \\\\\n&CancerGPT &0.033 &- &- &- &- &- &- &- \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.032 &- &- &- &- &- &- &- \\\\\n&GPT-3 &\\textbf{0.111} &- &- &- &- &- &- &- \\\\\n& & & & & & & & & \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Endometrium \\\\ ($n_0$=36, $n_1$=32)} &XGBoost &0.5 &0.5 &0.5 &0.5 &0.5 &0.5 &- &- \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.674 &0.889 &0.903 &\\textbf{0.948} &\\textbf{0.938} &\\textbf{0.962} &- &- \\\\\n&CancerGPT &0.564 &0.668 &0.676 &0.831 &0.686 &0.737 &- &- \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.408 &0.808 &0.395 &0.383 &0.389 &0.717 &- &- \\\\\n&GPT-3 &\\textbf{0.869} &\\textbf{1} &\\textbf{0.947} &0.859 &0.799 &0.859 &- &- \\\\ \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Liver \\\\ ($n_0$=192, $n_1$=21)} &XGBoost &0.132 &0.132 &0.132 &0.132 &0.132 &0.132 &0.12 &0.12 \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.13 &\\textbf{0.128} &0.147 &0.189 &0.265 &0.168 &0.169 &0.234 \\\\\n&CancerGPT &0.136 &0.102 &0.13 &0.147 &0.252 &0.21 &0.197 &0.187 \\\\\n&GPT-2 &\\textbf{0.5} &0.099 &\\textbf{0.151} &\\textbf{0.383} &\\textbf{0.429} &\\textbf{0.401} &\\textbf{0.483} &0.398 \\\\\n&GPT-3 &0.185 &0.086 &0.096 &0.125 &0.124 &0.314 &0.362 &\\textbf{0.519} \\\\ \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Soft tissue \\\\ ($n_0$=269, $n_1$=83)} &XGBoost &0.243 &0.243 &0.243 &0.243 &0.235 &0.235 &0.264 &0.271 \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.273 &0.287 &\\textbf{0.462} &\\textbf{0.422} &\\textbf{0.526} &0.571 &0.561 &0.64 \\\\\n&CancerGPT &\\textbf{0.314} &\\textbf{0.315} &0.338 &0.383 &0.383 &0.403 &0.464 &0.469 \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.259 &0.298 &0.254 &0.262 &0.235 &0.297 &0.254 &0.206 \\\\\n&GPT-3 &0.263 &0.194 &0.28 &0.228 &0.363 &\\textbf{0.618} &\\textbf{0.638} &\\textbf{0.734} \\\\ \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Stomach \\\\ ($n_0$=1081, $n_1$=109)} &XGBoost &0.104 &0.104 &0.104 &0.104 &0.104 &0.104 &0.09 &0.094 \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.261 &\\textbf{0.371} &\\textbf{0.396} &\\textbf{0.383} &\\textbf{0.294} &\\textbf{0.402} &\\textbf{0.45} &\\textbf{0.465} \\\\\n&CancerGPT &\\textbf{0.3} &0.297 &0.316 &0.325 &0.269 &0.308 &0.297 &0.312 \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.116 &0.124 &0.099 &0.172 &0.165 &0.107 &0.152 &0.131 \\\\\n&GPT-3 &0.078 &0.106 &0.17 &0.37 &0.1 &0.19 &0.219 &0.181 \\\\ \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Urinary tract \\\\ ($n_0$=1996, $n_1$=462)} &XGBoost &0.186 &0.186 &0.186 &0.186 &0.186 &0.197 &0.199 &0.209 \\\\\n&TabTransformer &0.248 &\\textbf{0.264} &\\textbf{0.25} &\\textbf{0.278} &\\textbf{0.274} &0.249 &\\textbf{0.293} &\\textbf{0.291} \\\\\n&CancerGPT &0.241 &0.226 &0.246 &0.239 &0.256 &\\textbf{0.271} &0.266 &0.269 \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.191 &0.192 &0.188 &0.156 &0.193 &0.185 &0.183 &0.185 \\\\\n&GPT-3 &\\textbf{0.27} &0.228 &0.222 &0.201 &0.206 &0.2 &0.24 &0.272 \\\\ \\\\\n\\multirowcell{5}{Bone \\\\ ($n_0$=3732, $n_1$=253)} &XGBoost &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 &0.064 \\\\\n&TabTransformer &\\textbf{0.123} &0.12 &0.121 &0.115 &0.102 &\\textbf{0.13} &\\textbf{0.129} &0.121 \\\\\n&CancerGPT &0.119 &\\textbf{0.115} &\\textbf{0.125} &\\textbf{0.116} &\\textbf{0.115} &0.11 &0.114 &0.125 \\\\\n&GPT-2 &0.063 &0.094 &0.057 &0.081 &0.052 &0.071 &0.057 &0.065 \\\\\n&GPT-3 &0.064 &0.051 &0.045 &0.058 &0.068 &0.087 &0.101 &\\textbf{0.181} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{AUPRC of $k$-shot learning on seven tissue sets. $n_0$:=total number of non-synergistic samples (not positive), $n_1$:=total number of synergistic samples (positive).

We calculated the AUPRC and AUROC of the LLM-based models (CancerGPT, GPT-2, GPT-3) and baseline models (XGBoost, TabTransformer) (Table \\ref{tab:auprc}, \\ref{tab:auroc}). Due to an imbalance in positive and non-positive labels, we reported both AUPRC and AUROC. Details on the classification task and threshold of synergy are discussed in Section \\ref{sec:hyperparameter}. \n\n\\paragraph{Number of training data and accuracy}\n\nOverall, the LLM-based models (CancerGPT, GPT-2, GPT-3) achieved comparable or better accuracy in most of the cases compared to baselines. In the zero-shot scenario, the LLM-based models generally had higher accuracy than the baseline models in all experiments except stomach and bone. As the number of shots increased, we observed mixed patterns across various tissues and models. TabTransformer consistently exhibited an increase in accuracy with more shots. CancerGPT showed higher accuracy with more shots in the endometrium and soft tissue, and GPT-3 showed higher accuracy with more shots in the liver, soft tissues, and bone, indicating that the information gained from a few shots of data complements the prior knowledge encoded in CancerGPT and GPT-3. \n\nHowever, the LLM-based models sometimes did not show significant improvements in accuracy in certain tissues, such as the stomach and urinary tract, suggesting that the additional training data do not always improve the LLM-based models' performance. \nWith the maximum number of shots ($k$=128), the LLM-based model, specifically GPT-3, was on par with TabTransformer, achieving the highest accuracy with the pancreas, liver, soft tissue, and bone, while TabTransformer achieved the best accuracy with endometrium, stomach, and urinary tract.\n\n\\paragraph{Tissue types and accuracy}\nThe accuracy of the models varied depending on the tissue types, as each tissue possessed unique characteristics and had different data size. In pancreas and endometrium tissues, GPT-3 showed high accuracy with only a few shots ($k$=0 or 2). Generally, the cell lines from the two tissues are difficult to obtain and have a limited number of well-established cell lines, which makes them less investigated. For example, the pancreas is located deep within the abdomen, making it difficult to access and isolate cells without damaging them. The endometrium is a complex tissue that undergoes cyclic changes during the menstrual cycle, and this dynamic process complicates the cell culturing process. Due to this limited training data, few-shot drug pair synergy prediction in these tissues required even higher generalizability.\n\nIn the liver, soft tissue, and bone, GPT-3 again achieved the highest accuracy than any other models, including one that trained with common tissues (TabTransformer, CancerGPT). This may be because these tissues have unique cellular characteristics specific to their tissue of origin that training with common tissues may not help predict accurately. For example, hepatic cell lines (originated from liver tissue) are often used in research on drug metabolism and toxicity and have unique drug response characteristics due to high expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (\\cite{guo_similarities_2011}). Bone cell lines have bone-specific signaling pathways that can affect drug responses, and the extracellular matrix composition and structure in bone tissue can also impact drug delivery and efficacy (\\cite{lin_bone_2020}). \n\nOn the other hand, models trained with common tissues (TabTransformer, CancerGPT) achieved the best accuracy in the stomach and urinary tract tissues of all $k$, indicating that the prediction learned from common tissues can be extrapolated to these tissues. Particularly, CancerGPT achieved the highest accuracy with no training sample ($k$=0) in the stomach.  \n\n\\paragraph{Comparing LLM-based models}\nWhen comparing LLM-based models, CancerGPT and GPT-3 demonstrated superior accuracy compared to GPT-2 in most tissues. GPT-3 exhibited higher accuracy than CancerGPT in tissues with limited data or unique characteristics, while CancerGPT performed better than GPT-3 in tissues with less distinctive characteristics, such as the stomach and urinary tract. The higher accuracy of CancerGPT compared to GPT-2 highlights that well-balanced adjustment to specific tasks can increase the accuracy while maintaining generalizability. However, the benefits of such adjustments may diminish with larger LLM models, such as GPT-3 (175B parameters), in situations where more generalizability is required.  The fact that CancerGPT with smaller parameters (124M parameters) achieved the comparable accuracy to GPT-3 with larger parameters (175B parameters) implies that further fine-tuning of GPT-3 could achieve even higher accuracy. \n\n\\subsection{Fact check LLM's reasoning}\nWe evaluated whether the LLM can provide the biological reasoning behind its prediction. In this experiment, we used zero-shot GPT-3 because other fine-tuned LLM-based models compromised its language generative performance during the fine-tuning and were not able to provide coherent responses. To do this, we randomly selected one true positive prediction and examined whether its biological rationale was based on factual evidence or mere hallucination. Our example was the drug pair AZD4877 and AZD1208 at cell line T24 for urinary tract tissue. We prompted the LLMs with \\emph{``Could you provide details why are the drug1 and drug2 synergistic in the cell line for a given cancer type?’’}. Details on prompt generation are discussed in Supplementary 1.  We evaluated the generated answer by comparing it with existing scientific literature. We found that the LLM provided mostly accurate arguments, except for two cases (Table \\ref{tab:reasoning}) in which no scientific literature exists. By combining these individual scientific facts the LLM inferred the unseen synergistic effect. Generally, drugs targeting non-overlapping proteins in similar pathways are more likely to be synergistic (\\cite{Cheng2019-dp, Tang2022-wn}).  In  this case, both AZD4877 and AZD1208 target similar pathways that inhibit tumor cell divisions without overlapping protein targets. The Loewe synergy score of this pair at T24 was 46.82, meaning strong positive synergistic effect.\n\n\\begin{table}[!htp]\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{3in}|p{3in}|}\\toprule\nExcerpt of the generated answer & Fact check and reference \\\\ \\hline\n\\emph{``The combination of AZD-4877 and AZD1208 has been studied in T24 cells...to be synergistic in reducing bladder cancer cell growth and metastasis''} &False.

However, AZD4877 has no evidence in reducing inflammatory mediators. \\\\ \\hline\n\\emph{``...these two drugs have been shown to reduce levels of apoptosis inhibitors, which can also play a role in tumor progression.''} &True. AZD1208 induce cell apoptosis (\\cite{Cervantes-Gomez2019-de}).

We randomly selected two true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative prediction examples.\nWe discovered that Loewe synergy scores of the true negative or false negative prediction examples were close to the threshold we used to categorize the label (i.e., Loewe score $>$5). This suggests that accuracy may vary significantly by different thresholds for determining positive synergy. Setting more extreme thresholds (e.g., $>$10, $>$30), like previous models (\\cite{kim_anticancer_2021}, \\cite{kuru_matchmaker_2022}, \\cite{hosseini_ccsynergy_2023}), may increase the prediction accuracy. \n\n\\section{Discussion} \n\n\\paragraph{Summary}\nOur study investigates the potential of LLMs as a widely applicable few-shot prediction model in the field of biology. Specifically, we propose a new few-shot model for predicting drug pair synergy, which can be used in rare tissues with few or no training samples available. We transformed tabular data prediction into natural language inference tasks and fine-tuned LLMs (GPT-2, GPT-3) with very few samples in each tissue. The CancerGPT model, which was further tuned with a large amount of common tissue data, showed comparable accuracy to the few-shot tuned GPT-3 model, indicating that tailoring GPT-3 to specific tasks could further improve prediction accuracy. The LLM's reasoning for its prediction revealed that it implicitly infers unseen synergistic effects by combining several independent scientific facts. \n\n\\paragraph{Why drug pair synergy prediction to evaluate LLMs}\nThe prediction of drug pair synergy in uncommon tissues serves as an excellent benchmark task for evaluating LLMs in few-shot learning within the field of biology. This prediction requires incorporating multiple pieces of information, such as drug and cell line, as well as the sensitivity of drugs to the cell lines, in order to infer the synergistic effects. While detailed information on these entities can be found in scientific papers, the interaction effect, or synergistic effect, is primarily available through biological experiments. To effectively assess LLMs' inference capabilities, one must employ a prediction task where the ground truth is not explicitly available in text format but can be determined through alternative sources for model evaluation. Typically, drug pair synergy scores are obtained through high-throughput testing facilities involving robot arms (\\cite{he_methods_2018}). Therefore, individual records of the experiments are seldom recorded in academic literature, decreasing the likelihood of their use as training data for LLMs. Additionally, few studies have been conducted on rare tissues regarding their synergy prediction models, and their synergy prediction outcomes are not explicitly stated in text format. Another similar task is predicting the sensitivity of a single drug in a cell line; however, since the sensitivity of individual drugs is extensively researched and well-documented in publications, the LLM model may merely recollect from the text rather than infer unseen tasks.\n\n\\paragraph{Comparison to existing drug pair synergy prediction models}\nIt should be noted that it was not possible to compare our LLM-based models with previous predictions of drug pair synergy. The majority of models necessitate high-dimensional features of drugs and cells (e.g., genomic or chemical profiles), along with a substantial amount of training data, even the one specifically designed for rare tissue (\\cite{kim_anticancer_2021}). This kind of data is not easily accessible in rare tissues, which makes it challenging to carry out a significant comparison. Our model is designed to address a common but often overlooked situation where we have limited features and data. Thus, we compared the LLM-based models with other tabular models that share the same set of inputs.\n\n\\paragraph{Contribution}\nThe contribution of our study can be summarized as follows. In the area of drug pair synergy prediction in rare tissues, our study is the first to predict drug pair synergy on tissues with very limited data and features, which other previous prediction models have neglected. This breakthrough in drug pair synergy prediction could have significant implications for drug development in these cancer types. By accurately predicting which drug pair will have a synergistic effect on these tissues in which cell lines are expensive to obtain, biologists can directly zoom into the most probable drug pairs and perform in vitro experiments in a cost effective manner. \n\nOur study also delivers generalizable insights about LLMs in the broader context of  biology. To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first to investigate the use of LLMs as an few-shot inference tool based on prior knowledge in the field of biology, where much of the latest information is presented in unstructured free text (such as scientific literature). This innovative approach could have significant implications for advancing computational biology where obtaining abundant training data is not readily possible. By leveraging the vast amounts of unstructured data available in the field, LLMs can help researchers bypassing the challenge of limited training data when building data-driven computational models. \n\nFurthermore, this LLM-based few-shot prediction approach could be applied to a wide range of diseases beyond cancer, which is currently limited by the scarcity of available data. For instance, this approach could be used in infectious diseases, where the prompt identification of new treatments and diagnostic tools is crucial. LLMs could help researchers quickly identify potential drug targets and biomarkers for these diseases, resulting in faster and more effective treatment development. \n\n\\paragraph{Limitations}\nThe present study, while aiming to showcase the potential of LLMs as a few-shot prediction model in the field of biology, is not without its limitations. To fully establish the generalizability of LLMs as a ``generalist'' artificial intelligence, a wider range of biological prediction tasks must be undertaken to validate it. Additionally, it is crucial to investigate how the information gleaned from LLMs complements the existing genomic or chemical features that have traditionally been the primary source of predictive information. In future research, we plan to delve deeper into this aspect and develop an ensemble method that effectively utilizes both existing structured features and new prior knowledge encoded in LLMs. \n\nFurthermore, while we observed that GPT-3's reasoning was similar to our own when fact-checking its argument with scientific literature in one example, it is important to note that the accuracy of its arguments cannot always be verified and may be susceptible to hallucination. It is reported that LLMs can also contain biases that humans have (\\cite{Schramowski2022-yg}). Therefore, further research is necessary to ensure that the LLM's reasoning is grounded in factual evidence. Despite these limitations, our study provides valuable insights into the potential of LLMs as a few-shot prediction model in biology and lays the groundwork for future research in this area.\n\n\\section{Method}\n\n\\subsection{Problem Formulation}\n\n\\paragraph{Objective}\nOur objective is to predict whether a drug pair in a certain cell line has a synergistic effect, particularly focusing on rare tissues with limited training samples. Given an input $$x = \\{d_1, d_2, c, t, ri_1, ri_2 \\}$$ of drug pair $(d_1, d_2)$, cell line $c$, tissue $t$, and the sensitivity of the two drugs using relative inhibition, the prediction model is $$y \\approx f(x) $$ where $y$ is the binary synergy class (1 if positive synergy; 0 otherwise).  Prior research (\\cite{10.1093/bioinformatics/btac579, hosseini_ccsynergy_2023}) has employed three different scenarios for predicting drug pair synergy (random split, stratified by cell lines, stratified by drug combinations). Our task is to predict synergy when the data are stratified by tissue, which is a subset of cell lines.\n\n\\paragraph{Why tabular input}\nAs discussed in Section \\ref{sec:related_works}, relationships learned in a tissue cannot be well generalizable to other tissues that have different cellular environments. This biological difference poses a challenge in predicting drug pair’s synergy in tissues with a limited number of samples. The limited sample size makes it even more difficult to incorporate typical cell line features, such as gene expression level, which has large dimensionality (e.g., $\\sim$ 20,000 genes). Due to this data challenge, the drug pair synergy prediction model is then reduced to build a prediction model with limited samples (few or zero-shot learning) with only limited tabular input feature types. Specific input features were described in Section \\ref{sec:experiments}.\n\n\\subsection{Synergy prediction models based on Large pre-trained language models}\n\\label{sec:convert}\n\n\\paragraph{Converting tabular input to natural text}\nTo use an LLM for tabular data, the tabular input and prediction task must be transformed into a natural text. For each instance of tabular data (Fig. \\ref{fig:study_workflow}), we converted the structured features into text. For example, given the feature string (e.g., ``drug1'', ``drug 2'', ``cell line'', ``tissue'', ``sensitivity1'', ``sensitivity2'') and its value (e.g., ``lonidamine'', ``717906-29-1'', ``A-673'', ``bone'', ``0.568'', ``28.871''), we converted the instance as \\emph{``The first drug is AZD1775. The second drug is AZACITIDINE. The cell line is SF-295. Tissue is bone. The first drug's sensitivity using relative inhibition is 0.568. The second drug's sensitivity using relative inhibition is 28.871.''} Other alternative ways to convert the tabular instance into the natural text are discussed in previous papers (\\cite{li_deep_2020, narayan_can_2022}).\n\n\\paragraph{Converting prediction task into natural text}\nWe created a prompt that specifies our tasks and guides the LLM to generate a label of our interest. We experimented with multiple prompts. One example of the prompts we created was \\emph{``Determine cancer drug combination synergy for the following drugs. Allowed synergies: {{Positive, Not positive}}. {{ Tabular Input }}. Synergy:''}. As our task is a binary classification, we created the prompt to only generate binary answers (\\emph{``Positive'', ``Not positive''}).  Comparing these multiple prompts (Supplementary 1), the final prompt we used in this work was \\emph{``Decide in a single word if the synergy of the drug combination in the cell line is positive or not. \\{\\{ Tabular Input \\}\\}. Synergy:''.}\n\n\\subsection{LLM-based prediction model}\n\\label{sec:llm-prediction-model}\n\\paragraph{Large pre-trained language models}\n\nWe built our prediction models by tuning GPT-2 and GPT-3 into our tasks (Fig. \\ref{fig:study_workflow}).  GPT-2 is a Transformer-based large language model which was pre-trained on a very large corpus of English data without human supervision. It achieved state-of-the-art results on several language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting when it was released, and it is the predecessor of GPT-3 and GPT-4. GPT-2 (\\cite{radford_language_nodate}) has several versions with different sizes of parameters, GPT-2, GPT-Medium, GPT-Large, and GPT-XL. We used GPT-2 with the smallest number of parameters (regular GPT-2, 124 million) in this work to make the model trainable on our server. To adjust the model for a binary classification task, we added a linear layer as a sequence classification head on top of GPT-2, which uses the last token of the output of GPT-2 to classify the input. The cross-entropy loss was used to optimize the model during the fine-tuning process (discussed below). \n\n GPT-3 (\\cite{brown_language_2020}) is a Transformer-based autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, which achieved state-of-the-art performance on many zero-shot and few-shot tasks when it was released. GPT-3.5, including ChatGPT (\\cite{openai_chatgpt}), a famous fine-tuned model from GPT-3.5, is an improved version of GPT-3. However, the GPT-3 model and its parameters are not publicly available.  Although the weight of the GPT-3 model is undisclosed, OpenAI offers an API (\\cite{openai_finetuning}) to fine-tune the model and evaluate its performance. We utilized this API to build drug pair synergy prediction models through $k$-shot fine-tuning. There are four models provided by OpenAI for fine-tuning, Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada, of which Ada is the fastest model and has comparable performance with larger models for classification tasks. For that reason, we use GPT-3 Ada as our classification model. After uploading the train data, the API adjusted the learning rate, which is 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 multiplied by the original learning rate based on the size of the data, and fine-tuned the model for four epochs. A model of the last epoch was provided for further evaluation. \n\n \\subsection{CancerGPT}\n \\label{sec:cancergpt2}\n We further tailored GPT-2 by fine-tuning it with a large amount of common tissue data, in order to adjust GPT-2 in the context of drug pair synergy prediction. We named this model CancerGPT. CancerGPT used the same structure as the modified GPT-2 mentioned above. A linear layer was added to the top of GPT-2, which uses the last token of the GPT-2 output to predict the label. To use the pre-trained GPT-2 model, the same tokenizer was used as GPT-2. Left padding was used to ensure the last token was from the prompt sentence. The cross-entropy loss was used to optimize the model.  \n\nCancerGPT was first fine-tuned to learn the relational information between drug pairs from common tissues, similar to collaborative filtering (\\cite{10.1093/bioinformatics/bty452}) (Fig. \\ref{fig:models}). This approach was based on the assumption that certain drug pairs exhibit synergy regardless of the cellular context, and therefore, the relational information between drug pairs in common tissues can be used to predict synergy in new cell lines in different tissues (\\cite{hosseini_ccsynergy_2023}). Additionally, we incorporated information on the sensitivity of each individual drug to the given cell line, using relative inhibition score as a measure of sensitivity (\\cite{10.1093/nar/gkab438}). By doing so, we were able to gather a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the relationship between drugs and cell lines.\n\nSubsequently, we utilized CancerGPT as one of the pre-trained LLMs and fine-tuned to $k$ shots of data in each rare tissue (as discussed in the following section). All the LLM models use the tabular input that was converted to natural text and share the same prompt.\n\n\\subsection{$k$-shot fine-tuning strategy}\n\\label{sec:k_shot}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering \n  \\includegraphics[width=6in]{figures/models.pdf}\n  \\caption{Training strategy of baseline and proposed LLM-based models. General tabular models and CancerGPT were first trained with samples from common tissues then $k$-shot fine-tuned with each tissue of interest. GPT-2 and GPT-3 are pre-trained models, and we fine-tuned them with $k$ shots of data in each tissue.}\n  \\label{fig:models} \n\\end{figure}\n\nThe LLM-based models had different training and fine-tuning strategies (Fig. \\ref{fig:models}). Samples of common tissues were split into 80\\% train data and 20\\% validation data for CancerGPT. The models were trained using train data and evaluated by validation data to determine the models with specific hyperparameters to be used for further fine-tuning on rare tissues. For the GPT-2 and GPT-3 based prediction models, we directly used pre-trained parameters from GPT-2 (\\cite{radford_language_nodate}) using Huggingface’s Transformers library (\\cite{wolf2020huggingfaces}) and GPT-3 Ada from OpenAI (\\cite{brown_language_2020}) respectively.\n\nAll these models were then fine-tuned with $k$ shots of data in each of the rare tissues. For bone, urinary tract, stomach, soft tissues, and liver, we performed experiments with $k$ from $[0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]$. For endometrium and pancreas, because of the limited number of data, we implemented experiments with $k$ from $[0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]$ from the endometrium, and only zero shot ($k$ = 0) for the pancreas.\n\nWith the limited number of shots, a careful balance of binary labels in the train and test set was critical. We partitioned the data into 80\\% for training and 20\\% for testing in each rare tissue, while ensuring the binary labels were equally represented in both sets. We randomly selected $k$ shots from the training for fine-tuning, while maintaining consistency with previously selected shots and adding new ones. Specifically, we maintained the previously selected $k$ shots in the training set and incremented additional $k$ shots to create $2 \\times k$ shots. The binary label distribution in each $k$ shot set followed that of the original data, with at least one positive and one negative sample included in each set. For evaluation stability, the test data was consistent across different shots for each tissue. \n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Dataset}\nWe utilized a publicly accessible extensive database of drug synergy from DrugComb Portal (\\cite{zagidullin_drugcomb_2019}), which is an open-access data portal where the results of drug combination screening studies for a large variety of cancer cell lines are accumulated, standardized, and harmonized. The database contains both drug sensitivity rows and drug pair synergy rows. After filtering the available drug pair synergy rows, the data contains 4,226 unique drugs, 288 cell lines, with a total of 718,002 drug pair synergy rows. We employed the Loewe synergy score, which ranges from -100 (antagonistic effect) to 75 (strong synergistic effect), for drug combination synergy. (\\cite{greco_search_1995})  The Loewe synergy score quantifies the excess over the expected response if the two drugs are the same compound (\\cite{ianevski_synergyfinder_2017, yadav_searching_2015}). In this paper, we focused on cell lines from rare tissues. We defined the rare tissues as the ones with less than 4000 samples, which include the pancreas (n=39), endometrium (n=68), liver (n=213), soft tissues (n=352), stomach (n=1,190), urinary tract (n=2,458), and bone (n=3985). We tested our models with each of the rare tissues. \n\n\\subsection{Baseline models}\nWe compared the LLM-based prediction model with two other tabular models that take the same set of inputs. We specifically used XGBoost (\\cite{Chen2016-bv}) and TabTransformer (\\cite{huang_tabtransformer_2020}). XGBoost is one of the gradient-boosting algorithms for supervised learning based on tree ensemble. for structured or tabular data. It is  widely used in large-scale drug synergy data (\\cite{Sidorov2019-np, Celebi2019-nl}).\n\nTabTransformer is a self-attention-based supervised learning model for tabular data. TabTransformer applies a sequence of multi-head attention-based Transformer layers on parametric embeddings to transform them into contextual embeddings, in which highly correlated features will be close to each other in the embedding space. Considering the highly correlated nature of drugs in our data, TabTransformer can be a very strong baseline in this work\n\nTo train the two baseline models, we first converted the drugs and cell lines in the tabular data into indicators using one-hot coding. Tissue information was not used in training because the models will be tested in one specific rare tissue that is not used in training. Neither XGBoost nor TabTransformer is a pre-trained LLM; thus, no further contextual information can be inferred through the unseen tissue indicator. For XGBoost, all the variables (drugs, cell lines, and sensitivities) were used as input to predict the drug pair synergy. For TabTransformer, we first trained an embedding layer from scratch on the categorical variables (drugs and cell lines) and passed them through stacked multi-headed attention layers, which we then combined with the continuous variables (sensitivities). This combination then passes through feed-forward layers, which have a classification head. \n\n\\subsection{Hyperparameter Setting}\n\\label{sec:hyperparameter}\n\nThe predicted output was a binary label indicating the presence of a synergistic effect, with a Loewe score greater than 5 indicating a positive result. We used AUROC and AUPRC to evaluate the accuracy of classification. Regression tasks were not possible in our LLM-based models because our model can only generate text-based answers (\\emph{``positive''} or \\emph{``not positive''}), with poor precision in accurately quantifying the synergy value. \n\nXGBoost was used with a boosting learning rate of 0.3. The number of the gradient boost trees was set to 1000 with a maximum tree depth of 20 for base learners. TabTransformer was used with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.01. The model was trained for 50 epochs on common tissues. During the training, the model with the best validation performance was selected for further fine-tuned on rare tissues. For each $k$ shot in each tissue, the model was fine-tuned using the same learning rate and weight decay for 1 epoch and tested with AUPRC and AUROC. Details in the hyperparameter setting are discussed in Supplementary 2.\n\nCancerGPT was first fine-tuned with pre-trained regular GPT-2 for 4 epochs on common tissues. The learning rate was set to be 5e-5 and weight decay was set to be 0.01. Then the model was fine-tuned for $k$ shots in rare tissues. The same hyperparameters are used in training. The model was finally tested with AUPRC and AUROC.\n\nGPT-2 and GPT-3 are directly fine-tuned on rare tissues with pre-trained parameters from regular GPT-2 and GPT-3 Ada. For each $k$ shot in each tissue, GPT-2 is fine-tuned for 4 epochs using a learning rate of 5e-5 and a weight decay of 0.01. The hyperparameters of GPT-3 are adjusted by OpenAI API based on the data size. The model was also fine-tuned for 4 epochs. GPT-2 and GPT-3 fine-tuned models were finally tested with AUPRC and AUROC.\n\n\\acks{XJ is CPRIT Scholar in Cancer Research (RR180012), and he was supported in part by Christopher Sarofim Family Professorship, UT Stars award, UTHealth startup, the National Institute of Health (NIH) under award number R01AG066749, R01AG066749-03S1, R01LM013712 and U01TR002062, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) \\#2124789.

Traditional approaches to tabular data learning have relied heavily on ensemble decision trees (DTs), such as gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT), due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, deep learning (DL) models, especially those designed for tabular data, are gaining traction due to their potential to handle multiple data types, enable end-to-end learning, and provide robustness against missing and noisy data. This summary focuses on three recent papers that explore novel DL architectures for tabular data learning and a few-shot drug pair synergy prediction model using large pre-trained language models (LLMs).\n\nThe first paper introduces TabNet, a deep learning architecture designed to improve performance and interpretability for tabular data. The second paper proposes TabTransformer, which leverages self-attention mechanisms from Transformers to enhance the prediction accuracy of tabular data. The third paper, CancerGPT, explores the use of LLMs for few-shot learning in predicting drug pair synergy in rare tissues, where structured data and training samples are limited. Each paper addresses different aspects of tabular data learning and drug synergy prediction, contributing to the broader field of DL and AI in biology and healthcare.\n\n#### Main Content of Each Paper\n\n**TabNet: Attentive Interpretable Tabular Learning**\nTabNet is a novel deep learning architecture for tabular data that uses sequential attention to select salient features at each decision step. This architecture enables instance-wise feature selection, which is crucial for efficient learning and interpretability. The model's design allows it to input raw tabular data without preprocessing, making it suitable for end-to-end learning. TabNet's performance is evaluated across various datasets, including synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating its ability to match or outperform traditional tree-based models and other DL models. The paper also introduces a self-supervised learning approach for TabNet, which significantly improves its performance when there is an abundance of unlabeled data.\n\n**TabTransformer: Tabular Data Modeling Using Contextual Embeddings**\nTabTransformer is a deep learning model that applies self-attention mechanisms from Transformers to tabular data, specifically focusing on categorical features. The model converts categorical features into parametric embeddings and then uses a sequence of Transformer layers to transform these embeddings into contextual ones. This approach allows the model to capture the interdependencies between features, leading to improved prediction accuracy. The paper evaluates TabTransformer's performance on fifteen publicly available datasets, showing that it outperforms traditional MLPs and matches the performance of GBDTs. Additionally, the paper explores the robustness of TabTransformer against noisy and missing data, and introduces a two-phase pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for semi-supervised learning, which significantly enhances its performance.\n\n**CancerGPT: Few-shot Drug Pair Synergy Prediction Using Large Pre-trained Language Models**\nCancerGPT is a few-shot learning model that leverages large pre-trained language models (LLMs) to predict drug pair synergy in rare tissues. The model converts tabular data into natural language text and uses LLMs to generate predictions based on the contextual knowledge encoded in the pre-trained weights. CancerGPT is evaluated on seven rare tissues from different cancer types, demonstrating its ability to achieve high accuracy even with very few or zero training samples. The paper also investigates the reasoning behind the LLM's predictions, showing that the model can provide accurate biological rationale by combining independent scientific facts. This approach highlights the potential of LLMs in addressing the challenge of limited structured data and sample sizes in rare tissues.\n\n#### Commonalities and Innovations\n\nAll three papers aim to improve the performance and applicability of deep learning models for tabular data. TabNet and TabTransformer focus on enhancing the interpretability and learning efficiency of DL models for tabular data, while CancerGPT explores the use of LLMs for few-shot learning in a specific biological task.\n\n**TabNet's Innovations:**\n- Sequential attention mechanism for instance-wise feature selection.\n- Sparse feature selection to improve learning efficiency.\n- Self-supervised learning approach to enhance performance with unlabeled data.\n\n**TabTransformer's Innovations:**\n- Use of self-attention mechanisms from Transformers to learn contextual embeddings for categorical features.\n- Robustness against noisy and missing data.\n- Two-phase pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for semi-supervised learning.\n\n**CancerGPT's Innovations:**\n- Transformation of tabular data into natural language text for LLMs.\n- Use of LLMs for few-shot learning in drug pair synergy prediction.\n- Evaluation of LLM's reasoning based on factual evidence from scientific literature.\n\n#### Comparison of Results\n\n**TabNet:**\nTabNet's performance is evaluated on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets, such as the Forest Cover Type, Poker Hand, Sarcos, and Higgs Boson datasets. The model outperforms traditional tree-based ensemble methods and other DL models, achieving high accuracy with compact representations. For instance, on the Forest Cover Type dataset, TabNet achieves a test accuracy of 96.99%, outperforming XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. On the Sarcos dataset, TabNet achieves a test MSE of 0.14 with a model size of 1.75M parameters, which is an order of magnitude lower than other models. \n\n**TabTransformer:**\nTabTransformer's performance is assessed on fifteen binary classification datasets, showing an average AUC gain of 1.0% over traditional MLPs and comparable performance with GBDTs. The model's robustness against noisy and missing data is demonstrated through experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets, such as the Higgs Boson dataset. TabTransformer-RTD and TabTransformer-MLM models outperform other competitors in semi-supervised learning scenarios, especially when the number of unlabeled data is large. For example, on the Higgs dataset with 10k samples, TabTransformer-MLM achieves a test accuracy of 78.84% with 0.66M parameters, which is comparable to the sparse evolutionary MLP with 81K parameters.\n\n**CancerGPT:**\nCancerGPT's performance is evaluated on seven rare tissues from different cancer types, demonstrating its ability to predict drug pair synergy with very few or no training samples. The model achieves significant accuracy, particularly in tissues with limited data, such as the pancreas and endometrium. For instance, on the pancreas tissue with only one positive sample, GPT-3 achieves an AUPRC of 0.789 in the zero-shot scenario. In the liver tissue, CancerGPT achieves an AUPRC of 0.782 with 16 shots of data, which is higher than the baseline models. \n\n#### Conclusion\nThe three papers contribute significantly to the field of tabular data learning and few-shot learning in biology. TabNet and TabTransformer introduce novel DL architectures that improve interpretability and learning efficiency, while CancerGPT demonstrates the potential of LLMs in few-shot learning tasks. TabNet's sequential attention mechanism and sparse feature selection enable efficient learning and interpretability, while TabTransformer's use of Transformers for contextual embeddings enhances prediction accuracy and robustness. CancerGPT's innovative approach of transforming tabular data into natural text and leveraging LLMs for few-shot learning shows promising results in drug pair synergy prediction, especially in rare tissues with limited data.\n\nFuture research could focus on further refining these models to handle more complex and diverse datasets, as well as investigating the integration of structured features with LLMs to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, the robustness and interpretability of LLMs in biological tasks could be explored in more detail, addressing the limitations of current models and ensuring that the reasoning provided is grounded in factual evidence. These advancements could have significant implications for drug development and computational biology, where obtaining abundant training data is often challenging.\n\n#### References\n- \\citep{resnet}: He, Kaiming, et al. \"Deep residual learning for image recognition.\" Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2016.\n- \\citep{rcnn_text}: Girish, K., & Jurafsky, D.
