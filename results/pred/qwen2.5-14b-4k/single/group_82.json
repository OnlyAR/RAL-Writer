To improve the performance of LLMs in the reasoning process, we study how decomposing the task into smaller sub-tasks can be effective. In particular, we show that breaking down the generation problem into sub-problems and feeding the solutions of those sub-problems into LLMs can be an effective approach for significantly improving their performance.\n  Our experiments with three LLMs show that this approach consistently improves their simple few-shot performance by roughly 10\\%, pushing the accuracy of LLMs towards SOTA or surpassing it.  \n  On the holdout test set of Spider, the SOTA, in terms of execution accuracy, was 79.9 and the new SOTA at the time of  this writing using our approach is 85.3. Our approach with in-context learning beats many heavily fine-tuned models by at least 5\\%. Additionally, when evaluated on the BIRD benchmark, our approach achieved an execution accuracy of 55.9\\%, setting a new SOTA on its holdout test set.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nNatural language interfaces to databases aim at making it easier for end users to access data in a relational database. For example, given the utterance ``find employees who make more than their managers'' and the schema of tables \\textit{employees} and \\textit{manages}, one may want to generate a query in SQL that retrieves those employees from a database.\nOver the past two decades, research in this field has progressed through several phases, with early systems being domain-specific, supporting controlled natural language \\citep{popescu2003towards,popescu2004modern,li2007nalix,li2014constructing} or relying on rule-based approaches \\citep{stratica2005using} \nwhile more recent systems offering greater domain-independence using supervised models trained on diverse domains and datasets~\\citep{zhong2017seq2sql,yu2018spider} and more recently deep neural models trained on large text and code repositories~\\citep{dong2016language,devlin2018bert}.\n\nThe latest development in this progression is the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) under zero-shot and few-shot prompting~\\citep{rajkumar2022evaluating,liu2023comprehensive}. It has been shown that LLMs provide strong baselines using only a few demonstrations and no fine-tuning~\\citep{chen2021evaluating,brown2020language,liu2023pre}. However, these models fall behind on commonly used benchmarks (e.g., Spider) compared to well-designed and fine-tuned models.\nTable~\\ref{tab:1} shows the performance of two latest LLMs, CodeX and GPT-4, on the development set of the Spider dataset. Despite a strong performance, LLMs fall behind, compared to existing methods \\citep{scholak2021picard,li2023decoupling}, especially on medium and complex queries. The question investigated in this paper is where these LLMs fail and if some of the problems that they are facing can be mitigated to push the performance to reach or surpass fine-tuned SOTA models.\n\nPrompting has several advantages over traditional approaches using pretraining or fine-tuning. The main benefit is that LLMs can perform prediction tasks without requiring large task-specific training data. Training models from scratch or fine-tuning them is a resource-intensive process, often requiring a large number of training samples and machine resources, which may not be available. Additionally, few-shot prompting has been shown to outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets and can achieve high accuracy even with limited training examples \\citep{brown2020language, wei2022chain}. \n\n\\definecolor{Silver}{rgb}{0.752,0.752,0.752}\n\\begin{wraptable}{r}{0.4\\linewidth}\n\\centering\n\\begin{adjustbox}{width=\\linewidth,center}\n\\begin{tblr}{\n  cells = {c},\n  row{1} = {Silver},\n  row{5} = {Silver},\n  cell{1}{1} = {c=2}{},\n  cell{5}{1} = {c=2}{},\n}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Fine-tuning approaches}                  &                             \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Method}                                  & \\textbf{Execution accuracy} \\\\\n\\hline\n{RED-SQL 3B + NatSQL\\\\ \\citep{li2023decoupling}\\\\~}   & 84.5                        \\\\\n{T5-3B + PICARD~\\\\ \\citep{scholak2021picard}\\\\~}      & 79.3                        \\\\ \n\\hline\n\\textbf{Inference-only approaches}               &                             \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Method}                                  & \\textbf{Execution accuracy} \\\\\n\\hline\n{Zero-shot GPT-4\\\\(Ours)}                           & 64.9                        \\\\\n{Few-shot GPT-4\\\\(Ours)}                            & 67.4    \n\\\\\n{Zero-shot CodeX\\\\ \\citep{rajkumar2022evaluating}}                           & 55.1                        \\\\\n{Few-shot CodeX\\\\ (Ours)}                            & 61.5   \n\\end{tblr}\n\\end{adjustbox}\n \\caption{Zero-shot and few-shot prompting compared to fine-tuned approaches on the dev set of Spider}\n\\label{tab:1}\n\\end{wraptable}\n\nIt has been recently shown that the performance of LLMs can be improved on more complex tasks (e.g., math word problems, compositional navigation steps) using approaches such as\nchain-of-thought \\citep{wei2022chain}, least-to-most \\citep{zhou2022least}, and decomposed \\citep{khot2022decomposed} prompting techniques where a task is broken down into multiple steps and the intermediate results are used to generate a final answer. Unlike algebraic expressions, which consist of clear steps or operations, breaking a complex SQL query can be a more daunting task because of the declarative structure of the language and the complex relationships between query clauses.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method based on few-shot prompting that decomposes the task of natural language text to SQL (referred to as text-to-SQL) into multiple sub-tasks. % for the challenging Spider dataset. \nPrevious works on text-to-SQL prompting using LLMs are only evaluated in a zero-shot setting \\citep{rajkumar2022evaluating,liu2023comprehensive}. However, zero-shot prompting only provides a lower bound on the potential power of LLMs for most tasks \\citep{zhang2022automatic, kojima2022large, wei2022chain, wei2021finetuned, brown2020language}. We show that our proposed method outperforms the few-shot prompting method by a large margin. We also compare our method with previous approaches on two cross-domain challenging benchmarks, Spider and BIRD. For Spider dataset, we use the two official evaluation metrics of \\textit{execution accuracy} and \\textit{exact set match accuracy} \\citep{ruiqi20}. We utilize two variants of the CodeX family, namely Davinci and Cushman \\citep{chen2021evaluating}, and the GPT-4 model for prompting. On the holdout test set of Spider, our method achieves an execution accuracy of 85.3\\% and 78.2\\% respectively using GPT-4 and CodeX Davinci models and an exact set match accuracy of 60\\% and 57\\% respectively using the same models. The large gap between the exact match and execution accuracies is due to the few-shot in-context nature of our method. Pretrained and fine-tuned approaches are more likely to generate SQL queries with a higher exact set match accuracy simply because these models have seen many examples during training that follow the composition style of the queries in the test set (queries in both sets are often written by the same people). Before our work, the SOTA on the test set had an execution accuracy of 79.9\\% \\citep{li2023decoupling} and an exact set match accuracy of 74\\% \\citep{li2023graphix}, and our method sets a new ground in terms of the execution accuracy. On the BIRD benchmark, our approach achieves a new SOTA result, attaining an execution accuracy of 55.9\\% on the holdout test set and 50.72\\% on the development set when employing GPT-4. Moreover, using the \\textit{valid efficiency score} introduced in this benchmark, our approach outperformed a GPT-4 baseline, demonstrating a 9\\% improvement on the development set. This highlights the effectiveness of our method.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) improving the performance of LLM-based text-to-SQL models through task decomposition, (2) introducing adaptive prompting strategies tailored to task complexity, (3) addressing schema linking challenges in the context of prompting, and (4) using LLMs for self correction. \nTo replicate the reported results, visit our GitHub repository~\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/MohammadrezaPourreza/Few-shot-NL2SQL-with-prompting}} for access to the prompts, results, and the code.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\nSequence-to-sequence models \\citep{sutskever2014sequence} have shown great potential in code generation tasks including text-to-SQL. The key idea is to jointly encode a given natural language question and the database schema and leverage a decoder to predict the target SQL.\n\nOn the encoder side, learning a representation for the question and the database schema is carried out using bidirectional LSTM in IRNet \\citep{graves2012long}, convolutional neural networks in RYANSQL \\citep{choi2021ryansql}, pretrained language models such as BERT in SQLova \\citep{hwang2019comprehensive} and graph neural networks in RATSQL \\citep{wang2019rat}, SADGA \\citep{cai2021sadga}, and LGESQL \\citep{cao2021lgesql}. \n\\citet{gan2021natural} propose an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the natural language question and SQL statements.\nThere has been also work on tabular language models that encode both tables and text such as TaBERT~\\citep{yin2020tabert}, TaPas \\citep{herzig2020tapas}, and Grappa \\citep{yu2020grappa}.\n\nThe methods on the decoder side can be categorized into sketch-based slot-filling and generation-based methods \\citep{qin2022survey}. \nSketch-based methods break the problem into several slot prediction  sub-problems and aggregate the predictions for the slots of the SQL query to be generated \\citep{hwang2019comprehensive, xu2017sqlnet, hui2021improving}. A drawback of these methods is that they cannot generalize to queries that do not follow the predefined templates. The generation-based methods \\citep{guo2019towards,wang2019rat,cao2021lgesql,huang2021relation} decode the SQL query as an abstract syntax tree.\n \nIn contrast to pretrained and fine-tuned models, \\citet{rajkumar2022evaluating} and \\citet{liu2023comprehensive} conduct an evaluation of the zero-shot prompting capability of LLMs on text-to-SQL using different prompts on the Spider dataset. Prompting techniques have been also used for tasks such as table understanding, table reasoning, and table-to-text generation \\citep{guo2023few,chen2022large}, and some remarkable results have been reported using LLMs with just a small number of examples given in the prompt.\n\n\\section{Few-shot Error Analysis}\n\\label{error_analysis}\nTo better understand where LLMs fail under a few-shot setting, we randomly sampled 500 queries from different databases in the training set of the Spider dataset, excluding all databases used in our prompts. We searched for the queries that produced results different than those of gold queries, hence failing the execution accuracy. We manually examined these failures and classified them into six categories as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:5} and discussed next.\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{graph2.png}\n  \\caption{Statistics of simple few-shot failures using CodeX Davinci (Op refers to operators, Cond refers to conditions, and cols refers to columns)}\n  \\label{fig:5}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Schema linking}\nThis category contained the largest number of failed queries and included instances where the model failed to identify column names, table names, or entities mentioned in questions. In some cases, the query required an aggregation function, but a matching column name was chosen instead. For instance, the database schema for question ``What are the average and maximum capacities for all stadiums?'' included a column named ``average'', which was selected by the model instead of taking the average of the capacity column.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{JOIN}\nThis was the second largest category and included queries that needed a JOIN but the model was unable to identify all the tables required or the correct foreign keys to join the tables.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{GROUP BY}\nThis category included cases where the SQL statement required a GROUP BY clause, but the model either did not recognize the need for grouping or wrong columns were used for grouping the results.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Queries with nesting and set operations}\\\\\nFor this category, the gold query used nesting or set operations but the model did not recognize the nested structure or was unable to detect the correct nesting or set operation.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Invalid SQL}\nA small set of the generated SQL statements had syntax errors and could not be executed. \n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Miscellaneous}\nThis category included cases that did not fit under any of the previously mentioned categories. Examples included SQL queries that contained extra predicates, missed a predicate, or had missing or redundant DISTINCT or DESC keywords. This category also included cases where the WHERE clause was missing or the query had redundant aggregation functions.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\n\\label{sec:method}\nDespite improvements over zero-shot, few-shot models struggle on more complex queries including those where schema linking is less trivial and the queries that use multiple joins or have a nested structure, as discussed in Section~\\ref{error_analysis}.\n\nOur approach to address these challenges is to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, solve each sub-problem, and use those solutions to construct a solution for the original problem. Similar approaches (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting~\\citep{wei2022chain} and least-to-most prompting~\\citep{zhou2022least}) have been taken to improve the performance of LLMs on tasks that can be broken down into multiple steps such as math word problems and compositional generalization~\\citep{cobbe2021training,lake2018generalization}. Unlike these domains where the tasks have a procedural structure with one step directly feeding into the next step, SQL queries in most parts are declarative and the possible steps and their boundaries are less clear. However, the thought process for writing SQL queries may be broken down to (1) detecting database tables and columns that are relevant to the query, (2) identifying the general query structure for more complex queries (e.g., group by, nesting, multiple joins, set operations, etc.), (3) formulating any procedural sub-components if they can be identified, and (4) writing the final query based on the solutions of the sub-problems.\n\nBased on this thought process, our proposed method for decomposing a text-to-SQL task consists of four modules (as depicted in Figure~\\ref{fig:1}):\n(1) schema linking, (2) query classification and decomposition, (3) SQL generation, and (4) self-correction, which are explained in detail in the following sub-sections. While these modules may be implemented using techniques from the literature, we implement them all using prompting techniques to show that LLMs are capable of solving them all if the problems are simply broken down to the right level of granularity. The few-shot examples used in the prompts are obtained from the training set of the respective benchmarks.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{Overview.png}\n  \\caption{An overview of the proposed methodology including all four modules}\n  \\label{fig:1}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsection{Schema Linking Module}\nSchema linking is responsible for identifying references to database schema and condition values in natural language queries.  It is shown to help with the generalizability across domains and the synthesis of complex queries~\\citep{lei2020re}, making it a critical preliminary step in almost all existing text-to-SQL methods  \\citep{cao2021lgesql, wang2019rat, guo2019towards, xuan2021sead}. This was also a single category with the largest number of failures made by the LLM in our case (Figure~\\ref{fig:1}).\n\nWe designed a prompt-based module for schema linking. The prompt includes ten randomly selected samples from the training set of the Spider dataset. Following the chain-of-thought template \\citep{wei2022chain}, the prompt begins with ``Let's think step by step,'' as suggested by \\citet{kojima2022large}. %The LLM divides the question into chunks where a column is mentioned. \nFor each mention of a column name in the question, the corresponding columns and their tables are selected from the given database schema. Possible entities and cell values are also extracted from the question. Figure \\ref{fig:2} illustrates an example and the full prompt can be found in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix A.3}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n     \\centering\n        \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\\textwidth}\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{new_schema_linking.png}\n        \\caption{schema linking module}\n        \\label{fig:2}\n        \\end{subfigure}\n     \\hfill\n        \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\\textwidth}\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{new_classification.png}\n        \\caption{classification and decomposition module}\n        \\label{fig:3}\n        \\end{subfigure}\n    \\caption{Examples showing the input and output of schema linking (left) and classification and decomposition (right)}\n    \\label{fig:two modules}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Classification \\& Decomposition Module}\nFor each join, there is some chance that a correct table or join condition is not detected. As the number of joins in a query increases, the chance that at least one join fails to generate correctly increases. One way to alleviate the problem is introduce a module that detects the tables to be joined. Also some queries have procedural components such as uncorrelated sub-queries, which may be generated independently and be merged with the main query.  \n\nTo address these issues, we introduce a query classification and decomposition module. The module classifies each query into one of the three classes: easy, non-nested complex and nested complex. The easy class includes single-table queries that can be answered without join or nesting. The non-nested class includes queries that require join but no sub-queries, and the queries in the nested class can contain joins, sub-queries and set operations. The class labels are important for our query generation module, which uses different prompts for each query class. In addition to class labels, query classification and decomposition also detects the set of tables to be joined for both non-nested and nested queries as well as any sub-queries that may be detected for nested queries.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:3} shows an example input given to the model and the output that the model generates.\n\n\\subsection{SQL Generation Module}\nAs the queries become more complex, additional intermediate steps must be incorporated to bridge the gap between the natural language question and the SQL statement. This gap, known as the \\textit{mismatch problem} in the literature \\citep{guo2019towards}, poses a significant challenge to SQL generation, which stems from the fact that SQL is primarily designed for querying relational databases and not representing the meaning in natural language \\citep{kate2008transforming}.\nWhile more complex queries can benefit from listing the intermediate steps in a chain-of-thought style prompting, such listings can degrade the performance for simpler tasks~\\citep{wei2022chain}.\nOn the same basis, our query generation comprises of three modules, each geared toward different classes.\n\nFor questions in our \\textit{easy class}, a simple few-shot prompting with no intermediate steps is adequate. The demonstration for an example $E_j$ of this class follows the format <$Q_{j} , S_{j}, A_{j}$>, where $Q_{j}$ and $A_{j}$ give the query text in English and SQL respectively and $S_{j}$ indicates the schema links.\n\nOur \\textit{non-nested complex} class includes queries that require join. Our error analysis (\\S~\\ref{error_analysis}) revealed that finding the right columns and foreign keys to join two tables can be challenging for LLMs under simple few-shot prompting, especially when the query requires joining multiple tables. To address this issue, we resort to an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between queries and SQL statements. Various intermediate representations have been introduced in the literature. In particular, SemQL \\citep{guo2019towards} removes operators JOIN ON, FROM, and GROUP BY, which have no clear counterparts in natural language queries, and merges the HAVING and WHERE clauses. \nNatSQL \\citep{gan2021natural} builds upon SemQL and removes the set operators. Expressions in natural language queries may not clearly map to a unique SQL clause or they may map to multiple clauses, so removing operators makes the transition from natural language to SQL easier.  As our intermediate representation, we use NatSQL, which is shown to have a state-of-the-art performance when combined with other models \\citep{li2023decoupling}. The demonstration for an example $E_j$ of the non-nested complex class follows the format <$Q_{j}, S_{j}, I_{j}, A_{j}$>, where $S_{j}$ and $I_{j}$ respectively denote the schema links and the intermediate representation for the jth example.\n\nLastly, the nested complex class is the most sophisticated type and requires several intermediate steps before generating the final answer. This class can contain queries that not only require sub-queries using nesting and set operations such as EXCEPT, UNION, and INTERSECT but also multiple table joins, same as the previous class. To break down the problem further into multiple steps, our prompt for this class is designed in a way that the LLM should first solve the sub-queries, generated from the previous module, and then use them to generate the final answer. The prompt for this class follows the format\n<$Q_{j} , S_{j}$ , <$Q_{j_{1}}, A_{j_{1}} , ... , Q_{j_{k}} , A_{j_{k}}$> , $I_{j}, A_{j}$>,\nwhere $k$ denotes the number of sub-questions, and $Q_{j_{i}}$ and $A_{j_{i}}$ respectively denote the $i$-th sub-question and the $i$-th sub-query. As before, $Q_j$ and $A_j$ denote the query in English and SQL respectively, $S_{j}$ gives the schema links and $I_{j}$ is a NatSQL intermediate representation.\n\n Full prompts for all three query classes are provided in Appendix \\ref{sec:appendix A.4}, and all examples for the three classes are obtained from the exact same training set database chosen for the classification prompt.\n\n\\subsection{Self-correction Module}\nThe generated SQL queries can sometimes have missing or redundant keywords such as DESC, DISTINCT and aggregation functions. Our experience with multiple LLMs indicates that these issues are less common in larger LLMs (e.g., queries generated by GPT-4 have less bugs than those from CodeX) but are still present. To address this, we propose a self-correction module where the model is instructed to correct those minor mistakes.\nThis is achieved in a zero-shot setting, where only the buggy code is provided to the model and it is asked to fix the bugs. %Inspired by this capability, our self-correction module feeds the LLM output to itself for the purpose of correcting issues with the generated SQL. The self-correction module is implemented in a zero-shot setting. \nWe propose two different prompts for the self-correction module: \\textit{generic} and \\textit{gentle}. With a generic prompt, we request the model to identify and correct the errors in the ``BUGGY SQL''. The gentle prompt, on the other hand, does not assume the SQL query is buggy, and instead asks the model to check for any potential issues and provides some hints on the clauses to be checked. Our evaluation indicates that a generic prompt can yield a better result with the CodeX model, while a gentle prompt is more effective for the GPT-4 model. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the default self-correction prompt in DIN-SQL is set to gentle for GPT-4 and generic for CodeX. \nExamples of both generic and gentle self-correction prompts can be found in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix A.6}.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\subsection{Models}\nWe evaluated the proposed method using two variants of the CodeX family (Davinci and Cushman variants) %\\citep{chen2021evaluating} \nand the GPT-4 model. These are the largest open-access LLMs at the time of writing this paper. Smaller models are less applicable since prompting is believed to be an emergent ability of the LLMs with the number of parameters in the scale of billions~\\citep{wei2022emergent}.\n\n\\subsection{Hyperparameter}\nAll models were accessed via the OpenAI API.

Spider consists of 10,181 questions and 5,693 unique complex SQL queries across 200 databases, covering 138 domains, each containing multiple tables. The standard protocol for this dataset divides it into 8,659 training examples across 146 databases, 1,034 development examples across 20 databases, and a holdout of 2,147 test examples across 34 databases. The databases used in each of these sets are non-overlapping. SQL queries are categorized into four difficulty levels, based on the number of SQL keywords used, the presence of nested subqueries, and the usage of column selections and aggregations. \nBIRD comprises an extensive dataset with 12,751 unique question-SQL pairs, encompassing 95 large databases totaling 33.4 GB in size. It spans a wide array of more than 37 professional domains, including blockchain, hockey, healthcare, and education. BIRD also introduces external knowledge as an additional resource to assist models in generating accurate SQL queries. Specifically four sources of external knowledge were introduced: numeric reasoning knowledge, domain knowledge, synonym knowledge, and value illustration. Notably, the SQL queries in the BIRD dataset tend to be more intricate than those in the Spider dataset. Language models without access to database content often encounter challenges with schema linking. Therefore, our prompts for the BIRD dataset include sample rows from each table to aid the model in schema linking.\nFurthermore, we have concatenated the provided external knowledge for each question as a hint, placed immediately after each question. However, due to constraints such as limited context window size, the presence of external knowledge, and the inclusion of sample rows, we have had to reduce the number of demonstrations within the prompts for the BIRD dataset.\n\n\\subsection{Metrics}\nThe performance of our models are evaluated using the official metrics of each dataset: exact-set-match accuracy (EM) and execution accuracy (EX) for Spider and valid efficiency score (VES) and execution accuracy (EX) for BIRD. \n\nThe exact-set-match accuracy (EM) treats each clause as a set and compares the prediction for each clause to its corresponding clause in the reference query. A predicted SQL query is considered correct only if all of its components match the ground truth. This metric does not take values into account.\nThe execution accuracy (EX) compares the execution output of the predicted SQL query with that of the ground truth SQL query on some database instances. Execution accuracy provides a more precise estimate of the model's performance since there may be multiple valid SQL queries for a given question, and exact set match accuracy only evaluates the predicted SQL against one of them. The Valid Efficiency Score (VES) is a metric designed to measure the efficiency of running the generated SQL queries. This metric is meaningful if the generated queries are correct, meaning their result matches that of the reference query.\nTherefore, the VES metric takes into account both the accuracy of the generated queries and their efficiency in terms of the execution time.\n\n\\subsection{Results}\n\\subsubsection{Test set results} \n\nAs shown in Table~\\ref{tab:2} for the holdout test set of Spider, our method achieves the highest execution accuracy using GPT-4 and the third-highest execution accuracy using CodeX Davinci among all officially published results at the time of this writing. This is achieved without even utilizing the database content. %The accessibility of the CodeX and GPT-4 models and the fact that our method does not require any database content make the task of generating SQL from natural language questions easily accessible for individuals without expertise in database or NLP domains. This holds true even for scenarios where we lack access to the database content. \nIn terms of exact set match accuracy, our method achieves comparable results to previous works that do not utilize database content. As demonstrated in Table~\\ref{tab: BIRD-test}, in the case of the BIRD dataset, our method using GPT-4 achieved a test set execution accuracy of 55.9\\%, setting a new SOTA.\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{graph.png}\n  \\caption{The break-down of failure cases for DIN-SQL (green) and the basic few-shot prompting (blue) across different categories}\n  \\label{fig:6}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\n\n\\subsubsection{Development set results}\n Most of our evaluation during development was conducted on the development set of Spider which was easily accessible unlike the test set that was only accessible through an evaluation server provided by \\citet{yu2018spider}. %To show how much our approach improves upon zero-shot and few-shot prompting, \n Table~\\ref{tab:3} shows the performance of our method using different LLMs, compared to zero-shot prompting of \\citet{rajkumar2022evaluating} and \\citet{liu2023comprehensive} and our own few-shot prompting. To ensure a fair comparison for the few-shot prompting, we incorporate all the examples utilized for our three classes (easy, non-nested complex, and nested complex) inside the prompt. Given that the CodeX Cushman model has a smaller input context size than the CodeX Davinci and the GPT-4 models, we only use 2 examples from each class (for a total of 6 examples). \n\nOur method significantly outperforms both simple few-shot prompting and zero-shot prompting, in terms of both exact set match and execution accuracies, and the improvement is consistent across all models despite their sizes. For example, compared to few-shot prompting, our method improves the execution accuracy for all models by at least 10\\%.\n\nOn the development set of BIRD, our approach demonstrates a substantial improvement, achieving a 4\\% gain in execution accuracy and a remarkable 9\\% improvement in valid efficiency score over a GPT-4 baseline~\\cite{li2023llm}, establishing a new SOTA. These and other results are reported in able~\\ref{tab: BIRD-dev}.\n\nThe performance of our method on the test set (as reported in Tables~\\ref{tab:2} and \\ref{tab: BIRD-test}) is higher than that on the development set for both Spider and BIRD. It is hard to pinpoint the exact reason when the test set is hidden, but we speculate that fewer questions in the test set may require the knowledge of the database content, making it easier for our method to predict a correct SQL query. Furthermore, the development set has schema ambiguity (e.g., a query entity can be mapped to multiple database entities but only one is considered correct), and it is possible that the test set has less ambiguity.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\begin{subtable}[h]{0.48\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\begin{adjustbox}{width=5cm,center}\n\\begin{tblr}{\n  cells = {c},\n  row{1} = {Silver},\n  hlines,\n  vlines,\n}\n\\textbf{Model}                                                                         & \\textbf{VES} & \\textbf{EX} \\\\\n{DIN-SQL + GPT-4  (Ours)}     &  59.44                        & \\textbf{55.9}                                \\\\\n{GPT-4}     & \\textbf{60.77}                        & 54.89                                \\\\\n{Claude-2}                                                                  & -                        & 49.02                                \\\\\n{ChatGPT + CoT \\\\\\ \\citep{li2023llm}}          & 56.56                       & 40.08                                \\\\\n{ChatGPT}           & 51.40                        & 39.30                              \\\\\n{Codex} & 41.60                        & 36.47                              \\\\\n{Palm-2}                 & -                        & 33.04                              \\\\\n{T5-3B}           & 27.80                        & 24.05                              \\\\\n{T5-Large}         & 25\t                        & 20.94                              \\\\\n{T5-Base}                                          & 14.7\t                      & 12.89                        \n\\end{tblr}\n\\end{adjustbox}\n \\caption{Execution accuracy (EX) and Valid Efficiency Score (VES) on the holdout test set of BIRD}\n \\label{tab: BIRD-test}\n\\end{subtable}\n    \\hfill\n    \\definecolor{Silver}{rgb}{0.752,0.752,0.752}\n\\begin{subtable}[h]{0.48\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\begin{adjustbox}{width=5cm,center}\n\\begin{tblr}{\n  cells = {c},\n  row{1} = {Silver},\n  hlines,\n  vlines,\n}\n\\textbf{Model}                                                                         & \\textbf{VES} & \\textbf{EX} \\\\\n{DIN-SQL + GPT-4  (Ours)}     & \\textbf{58.79}                        & \\textbf{50.72}                                \\\\\n{GPT-4}     & 49.77                        & 46.35                                \\\\\n{Claude-2}                                                                  & -                        & 42.70                                \\\\\n{ChatGPT + CoT \\\\\\ \\citep{li2023llm}}          & 42.30                        & 36.64                                \\\\\n{ChatGPT}           & 43.81                        & 37.22                              \\\\\n{Codex} & 43.41                        & 34.35                              \\\\\n{Palm-2}                 & -                        & 27.38                              \\\\\n{T5-3B}           & 25.57                        & 23.34                              \\\\\n{T5-Large}         & 22.74\t                        & 19.75                              \\\\\n{T5-Base}                                          & 12.90\t                      & 11.54                        \n\\end{tblr}\n\\end{adjustbox}\n\\caption{Execution accuracy (EX) and Valid Efficiency Score (VES) on the development set of BIRD}\n\\label{tab: BIRD-dev}\n\\end{subtable}\n\\caption{Performance of DIN-SQL on BIRD development set and test set.}\n\\label{tab:first tables}\n\\end{table}\n\nWe further analyzed the performance of our proposed method \non queries with different levels of difficulty.

To understand the degree those errors are resolved, we ran DIN-SQL on the same 500 queries. As shown in Figure \\ref{fig:6}, our proposed approach improves the performance for all categories with the largest improvement seen for the JOIN and Nested categories. Despite having an explicit module for schema-linking, the largest portion of failure cases still belong to this category.\n\\subsection{Ablation study}\n\nIn an ablation study, we evaluated our approach with and without each of the four modules. As shown in Table \\ref{tab:5} for the CodeX Davinci model, excluding any of the modules leads to an overall decrease in performance, in terms of the execution accuracy.\n\nMore details emerge as we study the effectiveness of each module across different query classes. Schema linking helps all query classes with the least improvement for the hard class. Our inspection of a sample of the failed cases reveals that schema linking sometimes finds redundant links due to an ambiguity in the question or schema, and this can introduce redundant joins or output columns.\n\nWithout a classification, we had to use either a simple few-shot prompting or a decomposed chain-of-thought (COT) prompting for all queries. The reported performance without a classification module in Table \\ref{tab:5} is for our comprehensive framework that includes all our components except classification. This means that the approach contains not only COT prompting but also Schema Linking, Self-Correction, and NatSQL Intermediate Representation, all of which are significant contributions of our work. The decomposed chain-of-thought result presented in this table refers to employing the most complex prompt, developed for the nested complex class, for all questions instead of adopting a classification-based approach to determine prompt complexity based on the question's level of difficulty. In contrast, the result for the DIN-SQL with simple few-shot prompting refers to using the simplest prompting class, easy class, for all questions across different level's of difficulty. As expected, a decomposed chain-of-thought prompting works better for hard and extra hard queries whereas a simple few-shot works better for the easy class.\n\nFor self-correction, we ran our study using both CodeX Davinci and GPT-4. For CodeX Davinci, a generic self-correction prompt helps the model across all query classes. A gentle self-correction prompt is also helpful but the gain is smaller than generic one for CodeX Davinci. However, there is less chance that GPT-4 generates a buggy code, and giving a generic prompt of ``Buggy SQL:$\\ldots$ Fixed SQL:$\\ldots$'' can hurt the performance. A gentle prompt work better for GPT-4 and improves the perfromance across all of the classes except the easy class.\n\n\\definecolor{Silver}{rgb}{0.752,0.752,0.752}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{adjustbox}{width=11cm,center}\n\\begin{tblr}{\n  cells = {c},\n  row{1} = {Silver},\n  hlines,\n  vline{1,9} = {1}{},\n}\n\\textbf{Prompting}                                                    & \\textbf{Model} & \\textbf{Easy} & \\textbf{Medium} & \\textbf{Hard} & \\textbf{Extra} & \\textbf{All} \\\\\nDIN-SQL (generic self-corr)                                              & CodeX Davinci  & \\textbf{89.1}          & 75.6            & \\textbf{58}            & \\textbf{38.6}           & \\textbf{69.9}         \\\\\nDIN-SQL (gentle self-corr)                                      & CodeX Davinci  & 87.5          & \\textbf{76.9}            & 51.7          & 36.1           & 68.7         \\\\\nDIN-SQL w/o self-corr                                      & CodeX Davinci  & 83.9          & 75.4            & 52.3          & 36.1           & 67.3         \\\\\n\nDIN-SQL w/o schema-linking                                       & CodeX Davinci  & 87.3          & 70.6            & 57.6          & 27.1           & 65.9         \\\\\n{DIN-SQL w/o classification\\\\(simple few-shot prompting)}  & CodeX Davinci  & 87.9          & 68.2            & 51.7          & 27.1           & 63.1         \\\\\n{DIN-SQL w/o classification\\\\(decomposed COT prompting)} & CodeX Davinci  & 84.2          & 71.2            & 54.3          & 38.6           & 68.2 \\\\ \\hline\nDIN-SQL (gentle self-corr)                                                & GPT-4           & \\textbf{91.1}          & \\textbf{79.8}            & \\textbf{64.9}          & \\textbf{43.4}           & \\textbf{74.2}           \\\\\nDIN-SQL (generic self-corr)\n&GPT-4           & 89.9                   & 76.5            & 59.2          & 34.3           & 70.0  \\\\\nDIN-SQL w/o self-correc                                      & GPT-4           & \\textbf{91.1}          & 79.1            & 63.2          & 41.6           & 73.3       \n\n\\end{tblr}\n\\end{adjustbox}\n\\caption{Performance of our method, in terms of execution accuracy, on the dev set with and without each module}\n \\label{tab:5}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\nPrompting has enabled large language models to achieve impressive performance on numerous NLP tasks across different domains, without requiring a large training set.\nPrior to our research, the effectiveness of prompting methods utilizing LLMs for the text-to-SQL task was inferior to that of models fine-tuned for the task. To bridge this gap, we have devised a decomposition technique to tackle some of the challenges that caused this disparity. Our extensive experiments on two challenging datasets of Spider and BIRD show that our method significantly improves the performance of prompting across all query classes, producing comparable or even superior results to state-of-the-art fine-tuned approaches.\n\n\\section{Limitations}\nThere are some limitations or areas of improvement to this work. Our manually constructed demonstrations are fixed for each query class. Future research may explore adaptive and automated methods for generating demonstrations at finer granularities, which can further enhance the performance of our approach. Additionally, as of the time of writing this paper, our proposed approach, characterized by its decomposed and step-by-step structure, incurs a cost of approximately \\$0.5 and exhibits a latency of approximately 60 seconds when responding to a natural language question from the Spider dataset using GPT-4. We anticipate that as LLMs continue to advance, these costs and latencies should decrease, but reducing the cost is another possible direction.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement}\nThis research was funded by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

challenging task in both natural language processing and database communities, maps natural language questions on the given relational database into SQL queries~\\cite{nl2sql1, nl2sql2}. \nMost previous works~\\cite{rat-sql, li2023graphix, li2023resdsql, DBLP:conf/acl/HuiGWQLLSL22, DBLP:conf/acl/ZhengWDWL22} focus on extracting the question-to-SQL patterns and generalizing them by training an encoder-decoder model with \\nlsql corpus. \nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for \\nlsql~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-13547, rajkumar2022evaluating, trummer2022codexdb}. \nNotably, equipped with GPT-4~\\cite{gpt4}, Pourreza et al.~\\cite{din-sql} achieved the first place in Spider leaderboard~\\cite{leaderboard} with $85.3\\%$ execution accuracy.\nDifferent from prior studies, the core problem in LLM-based \\nlsql solution is how to prompt LLM to generate correct SQL queries, namely prompt engineering. \nSuch prompt engineering involves question representations~\\cite{openaiprompt,dong2023c3,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-11853,din-sql}, examples selection~\\cite{DBLP:conf/acl-deelio/LiuSZDCC22, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-13301, enhancing}, and example organization~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-13301}.\n\n\\textbf{\\nlsql prompt engineering needs a systematic study.} \nAlthough prior studies have made remarkable progress, there still lacks a systematic study for prompt engineering in LLM-based \\nlsql solutions. \nSpecifically, for question representation, most existing research textualize structured knowledge as schema, and further add task instructions and foreign keys to form prompts~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-01598, enhancing}. \nBesides, some studies~\\cite{enhancing, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-11853} represent tables as several ``\\textit{CREATE TABLE}'' SQL statements, and prompt LLMs to answer the target question in comments. \nHowever, even with similar representation, their detailed task instructions can lead to significant performance gap. \nFor example, in OpenAI's official \\nlsql demo~\\cite{openaiprompt}, they employ the pound sign ``$\\#$'' to differentiate prompt from response, yielding an impressive performance~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-13547}; If such a sign is removed, the performance will significantly drop.\nTherefore, there are burgeoning demands for a systematic study over different representations and examine how to work well with LLMs. \nRegarding example selection, a common practice is to encode the most similar examples in the same representation with the target question~\\cite{enhancing, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-11853, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-13547}. \nNan et al.~\\cite{enhancing} further underline the importance of diversity in example selection. \nWhile for organization, most prior studies represent examples with full information, including instruction, schema, question and ground truth SQL queries. \nBesides, Guo et al.~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-13301} only keep SQL queries in the selected examples to guide the LLM with less tokens. \nTogether with different LLMs' preferences, the optimal selection and organization strategies in LLM-based \\nlsql solution remain ambiguous.  \nTherefore, a systematical study on prompt engineering, spanning different LLMs, question representations, example selection and organizations, is highly anticipated. \n\n\\textbf{The potential of open-source LLMs is underexplored.} \nVery recently, open-source LLMs are constantly expanding and show remarkable advancement in programming, mathematical reasoning, and text generation tasks. \nHowever, previous \\nlsql research primarily focuses on OpenAI LLMs, leaving open-source LLMs unstudied. \nBesides, compared with OpenAI LLMs, open-source ones generally have limited functionality in understanding context and generating coherent response. \nThus, a critical challenge for open-source LLMs is to further enhance their performance in \\nlsql, which can be achieved by supervised fine-tuning. \n\n\\textbf{Prompt efficiency remains a challenging open question.} \nIn LLM-based \\nlsql, another critical challenge is efficiency. \nThe reason is that most prior studies focus on OpenAI LLMs, and calling their APIs are expensive, time-consuming and restricted in rate limits~\\cite{ratelimites}, especially for in-context learning prompts with multiple examples. \nHowever, the prior studies may not well tackle this challenge. \nSpecifically, based on the observed inverted-U shape in execution accuracy with respect to prompt length, Chang et al.~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-11853} conjectures that LLMs may have a sweet spot in terms of prompt length, but leaves exploring efficient prompt engineering a challenging open question. \n\nIn light of above challenges, we focus on providing a comprehensive, systematical and fair benchmark for LLM-based \\nlsql. \nSpecifically, our benchmark discusses both the effectiveness and efficiency of various prompt engineering strategies, as well as the feasibility of open-source LLMs.\nThey are detailed as follows.\n\nTo provide a systematical and in-depth understanding of \\nlsql prompt engineering, we empirically evaluate several strategies from prior studies. \nFirst, we compare several typical question representations in zero-shot scenario with different LLMs, and identify their pros and cons.\nAfter that, we investigate example selection and organization strategies in few-shot scenario. \nFor example selection, we compare different selection strategies and further verify the hypothesis that LLMs learn from the mappings between question and SQL skeleton. \nRegarding example organization, we explore the option of displaying full information, solely SQL queries or question-SQL pair. \n\nAfter that, we highlight the potential of open-source LLMs in both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. \nSpecifically, we empirically study various open-source LLMs with different prompt engineering strategies, and observe the significant benefits of increasing scale of LLMs and having a good alignment \\cite{instructgpt}. \nTo further enhance their performance, we fine-tune and evaluate open-source LLMs using various representations. \nWith this comparison, we demonstrate that similar to in-context learning, representation strategy is also critical for supervised fine-tuning. \nThese explorations underline the potential of an effective solution for \\nlsql.\nMoreover, after fine-tuning we also observe a decrease in in-context learning capability, which requires further study. \nWe believe these explorations will benefit practical \\nlsql applications.\n\n \nTowards a more economic and efficient solution, we further evaluate different strategies in terms of token efficiency. \nSuch evaluation aims at searching for a cost-effective strategy, which is supposed to achieve considerable performance with less tokens. \nTo fulfill such goal, we consider token efficiency in the whole process of prompt engineering, including choices for question representation, example selection and organization.\n\nLast but not least, our integrated solution, named \\ours, refreshes the Spider leaderboard with $86.6\\%$ execution accuracy, and wins the first place. \nCompared with previous solutions, \\ours encodes structure knowledge as SQL statements, selects examples based on their skeleton similarities and removes cross-domain knowledge from examples for token efficiency. \nBefore \\ours, the state-of-the-art performance in the Spider leaderboard is $85.3\\%$~\\cite{din-sql}. \nTherefore, our solution sets a new bar, and hope our comprehensive study will inspire more further works. \n\n\\textbf{Contribution} Our main contributions and results are summarized as follows: \n\\begin{itemize} \n    \\item \\revision{We systematically study prompt engineering for LLM-based \\nlsql methods, including five question representations, two prompt components, four example selections, and three example organizations on four LLMs. The study sheds light on identifying suitable question representations and key points to leverage the in-context learning capacity of LLMs for \\nlsql task.}\n    \\item \\revision{To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore open-source LLMs for both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning for \\nlsql task.

cost.}\n\\end{itemize}\n\\section{Preliminary}\n\\label{sec:preliminary}\n\n\\nlsql aims at automatically translating natural language questions into SQL queries. \nIt bridges the gap between non-expert users and database systems, greatly improves the efficiency of data processing, and contributes to a wider range of applications such as intelligent database service, automatic data analysis and database question-answering.  \nHowever, \\nlsql is still a quiet challenging task, due to the difficulty in fully understanding natural language questions and generating correct SQL queries~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2208-13629,nl2sql1}. \n\nExtensive studies of \\nlsql have been conducted in both database and natural language processing communities. \n\\revision{\nSome early studies tackle \\nlsql task with pre-defined rules or query enumeration~\\cite{DBLP:journals/pvldb/SenLQOEDSMSS20, DBLP:conf/sigmod/BaikJCJ20, quamar2022natural}, or treat it as a sequence-to-sequence task, focusing on training machine learning models with an encoder-decoder architecture~\\cite{DBLP:conf/ijcai/CaiXZYLL18, DBLP:conf/coling/PopescuMVYKS22, qi2022rasat}.\nWith rapid advancement of deep learning, numerous techniques are applied to help \\nlsql task, such as attention mechanism~\\cite{DBLP:conf/ijcnn/LiuSZWLK23}, graph representation~\\cite{DBLP:conf/emnlp/XuWWFS18, li2023graphix, DBLP:conf/acl/ZhengWDWL22, rat-sql, qi2022rasat, DBLP:conf/acl/HuiGWQLLSL22}, syntax parsing~\\cite{DBLP:conf/acl/GuoZGXLLZ19, scholak2021picard, li2023resdsql, wang2022proton}, etc. \nOne of the most representative is BERT~\\cite{bert}, which has been widely used in \\nlsql and achieved SOTA performances at that time~\\cite{valuenet, tabert}. \n}\nBesides, to narrow the gap between \\nlsql research and its real-world deployment, numerous large-scale benchmark datasets have been released, including WikiSQL~\\cite{wikisql}, Spider~\\cite{spider}, KaggleDBQA~\\cite{kaggledbqa}, BIRD~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-03111} etc. \nWith these great efforts, the research communities have made impressive progress in \\nlsql. \n\nRecently, large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 \\cite{gpt4} from OpenAI and LLaMA \\cite{llama} from Meta, have emerged as a milestone for natural language processing and machine learning. \nDifferent from general machine learning model, LLMs are pre-trained on massive text corpus, which can perform various natural language tasks.\nThe basic operating principle is to gradually produce the next word that has the highest probability based on the input prompt~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-18223}. \nTherefore, to tackle \\nlsql task with LLMs, the core is to find the optimal prompt, also known as prompt engineering~\\cite{enhancing, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-13547}. \n\nSpecifically, according to number of examples provided in prompt, prompt engineering are classified into two scenarios: zero-shot scenario and few-shot scenario. \nIn zero-shot scenario, no example is provided, and the main challenge is to represent the natural language question effectively, including incorporating relevant information such as the corresponding database schema~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-11853, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-13547, trummer2022codexdb, dong2023c3}. \n\\revision{In this paper, the process of representing natural language questions and relevant information is referred to as {\\bf{question representation}}.}\n\\revision{\nWhile in few-shot scenario, a limited number of examples are available, thus besides question representation, we also need to study how to select the most helpful examples and organize them in the prompt appropriately. \nIn natural language processing, the above progress that LLMs learn from contextual examples is named as {\\bf{in-context learning}}~\\cite{icl22}. \nIt enables LLMs to identify explicit or inexplicit patterns from the input prompt, and generate corresponding outputs. \nIn this way, LLMs are capable of new tasks during inference without any explicit task-specific training phase. \nRecent studies~\\cite{din-sql, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-13301, DBLP:conf/acl-deelio/LiuSZDCC22} confirm the significant role of including examples for effective in-context learning.\n}\nIn this paper, we will discuss in-context learning in the scope of example selection and example organization.\n\n\\revision{Although LLMs are demonstrated to be effective in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios in prior studies~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-01598, enhancing, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-13547, sun2023sql, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-11853}, their performances can be further enhanced by {\\bf{supervised fine-tuning (SFT)}}, which enhances LLMs using additional task-specific training data to make it more suitable for specific downstream tasks. \nIn recent researches, supervised fine-tuning is used as a training paradigms of \\textbf{Alignment}, which aligns LLMs' behavior to avoid generating offensive, biased responses and hallucinations~\\cite{chatgpt}. \nIn this paper, we will focus on enhancing LLMs' \\nlsql capabilities with supervised fine-tuning.\n}\nIt is worth noting that despite the extensive research on prompt engineering for \\nlsql, there is a scarcity of studies exploring the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs for \\nlsql~\\cite{sun2023sql}, leaving this area as an open question. \n\nIn summary, question representation, in-context learning, together with supervised fine-tuning are three essential knobs in large language model based \\nlsql. \nIn this paper, we will provide a systematical study and discussion about them. \n\\section{Methodology}\n\nAs stated above, in this paper we focus on question representation, in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. \nIn this section, we provide formal definitions for these three problems, survey their existing solutions systematically, and point out the potential issues in existing techniques. \nTo address these issues, we propose a new \\nlsql prompt engineering method, named \\ours, which refreshes the best performance in Spider leaderboard with $86.6\\%$ execution accuracy. \n\n\\subsection{Question

\\nlsql.\nConsidering a target question $q$ in natural language on certain database $\\mathcal{D}$, the target of question representation is to maximize the possibility of LLM $\\mathcal{M}$ generating the correct SQL $s^*$ as follows:\n\\begin{align*} \n    \\centering\n    \\underset{\\sigma}{\\max}\\qquad &\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathcal{M}}(s^*|\\sigma(q, \\mathcal{D})),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere function $\\sigma(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ decides representation for target question $q$, with the useful information from the schema of database $\\mathcal{D}$. \nBesides, $\\sigma(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ also can include information such as instruction statement, rule implication and foreign key.\n{\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Prompt, caption={Example of \\bsprompt}, float=t, label={lst:bsprompt}]\nTable

choices of $\\sigma$ in zero-shot scenario and choose four most representative ones from literature. \nIn addition, we also include the question representation used in Alpaca~\\cite{alpaca} since it's popular in supervised fine-tuning. \n\\tabref{tab:related_work} summarizes these five representation methods and lists their reported details from their original papers. \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{\\bsprompt} (\\abbsprompt). \n    \\bsprompt~\\cite{din-sql} is a simple representation shown in \\lstref{lst:bsprompt}. \n    It is consisted of table schemas, natural language question prefixed by ``\\textit{Q: }'' and a response prefix ``\\textit{A: SELECT}'' to prompt LLM to generate SQL. \n    In this paper we named it as \\bsprompt due to its absence of instructions.\n    \n    \\item \\textbf{\\textprompt} (\\abtextprompt). \n    As shown in \\lstref{lst:textprompt}, \\textprompt \\cite{enhancing} represents both schema and question in natural language.\n

\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-13547, din-sql}. \n    It's consisted of instruction, table schemas, and question, where all information are commented by pound sign ``$\\textit{\\#}$''. \n    Compared with \\textprompt, the instruction in \\openaiprompt is more specific with a rule, ``\\textit{Complete sqlite SQL query only and with no explanation}'', which we will further discuss in the \\secref{sec:chatgpt} along with experimental results. \n    \n    \\item \\textbf{\\sqlprompt} (\\absqlprompt). \n    The \\sqlprompt \\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-11853, enhancing} presents \\nlsql task in SQL syntax. \n    Specifically, as shown in \\lstref{lst:sqlprompt}, it directly presents ``\\textit{CREAT TABLE}'' SQLs, and prompts LLM with natural language question in comments. \n    Compared with other representations, \\absqlprompt stands out due to its ability to provide comprehensive information necessary for database creation, such as column types and primary/foreign keys.\n    With such a representation, \\cite{enhancing} correctly predicts about $75.6\\%$ SQLs with LLM CODE-DAVINCI-002. \n    \n    \\item \\textbf{\\alpacaprompt} (\\abalpacaprompt). \n    The

context in Markdown format. \n    We include it to examine its effectiveness and efficiency in both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning scenarios. \n

Therefore, in this subsection, we discuss the keys of in-context learning, that are example selection and example organization. We first give a formulation of in-context learning to ease the further discussions. \n\nIn \\nlsql, given a set of triples $\\mathcal{Q} = \\{(q_i, s_i, \\mathcal{D}_i)\\}$, where $q_i$ and $s_i$ are natural language question and its corresponding SQL query on database $\\mathcal{D}_i$, the target of in-context learning for \\nlsql is to maximize the possibility of LLM $\\mathcal{M}$ generating the correct SQL $s^*$ on the target question $q$ and database $\\mathcal{D}$ as follows:\n\\begin{align*} \n    \\underset{\\mathcal{Q}', \\sigma}{\\max}\\qquad &\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathcal{M}}(s^*|\\sigma(q, \\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{Q}')), \\\\\n    \\mathrm{s.t.}\\qquad|&\\mathcal{Q}'| = k\\quad\\mathrm{and} \\quad\\mathcal{Q}' \\subset \\mathcal{Q},\n\\end{align*}\nwhere function $\\sigma(\\cdot, \\cdot, \\cdot)$ decides representation for target question $q$, with the useful information from the schema in database $\\mathcal{D}$ and $k$ examples selected from $\\mathcal{Q}$. In this paper, we focus on \\emph{cross-domain \\nlsql}, which means the target database $\\mathcal{D}$ is not included among the databases $\\mathcal{D}_i$ mentioned in $\\mathcal{Q}$., i.e., $\\mathcal{D} \\notin \\{\\mathcal{D}_i|(q_i, s_i, \\mathcal{D}_i) \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\}$.\n\nIn-context learning for \\nlsql involves selecting the most helpful examples $\\mathcal{Q'}$ and deciding how to organize the information of these selected examples into prompt. \nNext we discuss these two sub-tasks: example selection and example organization. \n\n\\subsubsection{Example Selection}\n\\label{subsubsec:exp_select}\n\nWe summarize various example selection strategies in prior studies as follows.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Random}. This strategy randomly samples $k$ examples from the available candidates. Previous works~\\cite{DBLP:conf/acl-deelio/LiuSZDCC22, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-13301, enhancing} have adopted it as a baseline for example selection. \n    \\item \\textbf{\\qsselector} (\\abqsselector). \\abqsselector~\\cite{DBLP:conf/acl-deelio/LiuSZDCC22} chooses $k$ examples with the most similar questions. \n    Specifically, it embeds both example questions in $\\mathcal{Q}$ and the target question $q$ with a pre-trained language model. \n    Then it applies a pre-defined distance measure, such as the Euclidean distance or negative cosine similarity, to each example-target pair. Finally $k$NN algorithm is leveraged to select $k$ examples from $\\mathcal{Q}$ that closely match the target question $q$. \n\n    \\item \\textbf{\\slmselector} (\\abslmselector). For cross-domain \\nlsql, \\abslmselector~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-13301} eliminates the negative influence of domain-specific information by replacing table names, column names, and values in all questions with a mask token, and then compute the similarities of their embedding with $k$NN algorithm.\n    \\item \\textbf{\\qrsselector} (\\abqrsselector). Instead of using the target question $q$, \n    \\abqrsselector~\\cite{enhancing} aims to select $k$ examples that are similar to target SQL query $s^*$. \n    Specifically, it employs a preliminary model to generate SQL query $s'$ using target question $q$ and database $D$, where this generated $s'$ can be regarded as an approximation of $s^*$. \n    Then it encodes queries from examples into binary discrete syntax vectors according to their keywords. \n    After that, it chooses $k$ examples by considering both similarity to the approximated query $s'$ and diversity among selected examples. \n\\end{itemize}\n\nAbove strategies focus on selecting examples using only target question or query. \nHowever, according to prior studies~\\cite{icl22}, in-context learning is essentially learning from analogy. \nIn the case of \\nlsql, the objective is to generate queries that match the given questions, thus LLMs are supposed to learn the mapping from questions to SQL queries. \nTherefore, we point out that during example selection, taking both question and SQL queries into consideration may benefit \\nlsql task. \nWe will further discuss it in \\secref{sec:dail-sql}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Example Organization} \nThe example organization plays a pivotal role in determining what information of the above selected examples will be organized into the prompt. \nWe summarize existing strategies in prior studies into two categories, \\fiorg and \\sqlorg, \nas demonstrated in \\lstref{lst:org_complete} and \\lstref{lst:org_sql}. \nIn these examples, $\\textit{\\$\\{DATABASE\\_SCHEMA\\}}$ represents the database schema, and $\\textit{\\$\\{TARGET\\_QUESTION\\}}$ stands for the question representation in \\lstref{lst:sqlprompt}.\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Prompt, label={lst:org_complete}, caption={Example of \\fiorg.}, float=t]\n/* Given the following database schema: */\n${DATABASE_SCHEMA}\n/* Answer the following: How many authors are there? */\nSELECT count(*) FROM authors\n\n/* Given the following database schema: */\n${DATABASE_SCHEMA}\n/* Answer the following: How many farms are there? */\nSELECT count(*) FROM farm\n\n${TARGET_QUESTION}\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Prompt, label={lst:org_sql}, caption={Example of \\sqlorg.}, float=t]\n/* Some SQL examples are provided based on similar problems: */\nSELECT count(*) FROM authors\n\nSELECT count(*) FROM farm\n\n${TARGET_QUESTION}\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Prompt, label={lst:org_qa}, caption={Example of \\pairorg.}, float=t]\n/* Some example questions and corresponding SQL queries are provided based on similar problems: */\n/* Answer the following: How many authors are there? */\nSELECT count(*) FROM authors\n\n/* Answer the following: How many farms are there?. */\nSELECT count(*) FROM farm\n\n${TARGET_QUESTION}\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{\\fiorg} (\\abfiorg). \n    \\abfiorg~\\cite{enhancing, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-11853} organizes examples in the same representation with the target question.  \n    As shown in \\lstref{lst:org_complete}, examples are structured identically to the target question, and the only difference is that instead of the ``\\textit{SELECT}'' token at the end, the selected examples have the corresponding SQL queries after ``\\textit{SELECT}''. \n    \\item \\textbf{\\sqlorg} (\\absqlorg).\n    \\absqlorg~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-13301} includes only SQL queries of the selected examples with a prefix instruction in the prompt, as demonstrated in~\\lstref{lst:org_sql}.\n    Such organization aims at maximizing the number of examples with limited token length. \n    However, it removes the mapping information between questions and corresponding SQL queries, and such information can be useful, which we will demonstrate later.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn summary, \\abfiorg includes the full information of examples, which ensures the quality; \nwhile \\absqlorg only keeps SQL queries to accommodate more examples, which prefers the quantity. \nWe wonder if there exists a better trade-off between quality and quantity in example organization\n, which can further benefit the \\nlsql task.\n\n\\subsection{\\ours}\n\\label{sec:dail-sql}\nTo address the aforementioned issues in example selection and organization, in this subsection, we present a novel \\nlsql method named \\ours. \n\\revision{Please refer to \\appref{dail-sql:pseudocode} for the pseudocode of \\ours.} \n\nFor example selection, inspired by \\abslmselector and \\abqrsselector, we proposed \\textbf{\\pqsselector} (\\abpqsselector), considering both questions and queries to select candidates. \nSpecifically, \\pqsselector first masks domain-specific words in both target question $q$ and example questions $q_i$ in the candidate set $\\mathcal{Q}$. \nIt then ranks the candidate examples based on the Euclidean distance between the embeddings of masked $q$ and $q_i$. Simultaneously, it calculates the query similarity between the pre-predicted SQL query $s'$ and $s_i$ in $\\mathcal{Q}$. \nFinally, the selection criterion prioritizes the sorted candidates by question similarity with a query similarity greater than a predefined threshold $\\tau$. In this way, the selected top $k$ examples have good similarity with both question and query.\n\nTo preserve the mapping information between questions and SQL queries and also improve the token efficiency, we propose a new example organization strategy \\textbf{\\pairorg} (\\abpairorg) to trade-off in terms of quality and quantity.\nSpecifically, \\abpairorg presents both questions $q_i$ and corresponding SQL queries $s_i$, as illustrated in~\\lstref{lst:org_qa}. As a compromise between \\abfiorg and \\absqlorg, \\abpairorg reserves the question-SQL mapping, and reduces the token length of examples by removing token-cost database schema.\n\nIn \\ours, we adopt \\absqlprompt as our question representation.\nThe reason is that compared with other representations, \\absqlprompt contains full information of the database, including primary and foreign keys, which may offers more useful information for LLMs, such as foreign keys for the prediction of ``JOIN'' clauses. \nBesides, pre-trained on extensive coding corpora, LLMs could better understand the prompt in \\absqlprompt without too much additional effort. \n\nIn summary, \\ours utilizes \\absqlprompt as the question representation, selects examples based on information from both question and query, and organizes them to keep question-to-SQL mappings. In such prompt design, LLMs could work better for \\nlsql task, and in Spider leaderboard, the proposed \\ours refresh the performance with $86.2\\%$ execution accuracy.\n\nNote \\ours is a flexible LLM-based \\nlsql solution, which can be further extended and integrated with other components easily. \nFor example, to improve the performance, we equip \\ours with self-consistency~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/0002WSLCNCZ23}, which achieves a performance of $86.6\\%$ execution accuracy. \nAlthough self-consistency improves the execution accuracy by $0.4\\%$, it is very time consuming and yields many times the cost of original \\ours. \nTherefore, in this paper we still focus on \\ours. \n\n\\subsection{Supervised Fine-Tuning for \\nlsql}\nTo enhance the performance of LLMs in zero-shot scenario, the popular option for existing \\nlsql methods is in-context learning, which is \\revision{discussed} in above subsections. As an alternative yet promising option, supervised fine-tuning is less explored so far.  \nSimilar to supervised fine-tuning for various language task, we can adopt it to the field of \\nlsql, and improve LLMs' performance on this downstream task. \nTo further understand how supervised fine-tuning works for \\nlsql, we first provide a brief formulation as follows.\n\nFor \\nlsql, given a large language model $\\mathcal{M}$, a set of \\nlsql training data $\\mathcal{T}=\\{(q_i, s_i, \\mathcal{D}_i)\\}$, where $q_i$ and $s_i$ are the natural language question and its corresponding query on database $\\mathcal{D}_i$, the objective of supervised fine-tuning is to minimize the following empirical loss:\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\min_{\\sigma, \\mathcal{M}^*} \\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{T}|}{\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{M^*}}(\\sigma(q_i, \\mathcal{D}_i), s_i)},\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function to measure the difference between the generated query and the groundtruh query. Similar to question representation, $\\sigma$ decides question representation with useful information from the schema in database $\\mathcal{D}$. \nIn this definition, supervised fine-tuning for \\nlsql covers two sub-tasks, including fine-tuning the given LLM $\\mathcal{M}$ using supervised data $\\mathcal{T}$ in order to get the optimal LLM $\\mathcal{M}^*$, and searching for the optimal question representation $\\sigma$. \nSince question representations have been discussed in~\\secref{subsec:question_representation}, this section will primarily focus on data preparation $\\mathcal{T}$ and fine-tuning. \n\nFor general domain, each item in supervised data $\\mathcal{T} = \\{(p_i, r_i)\\}$ contains an input prompt $p_i$ and an expected respond $r_i$ from LLM. \nTo ensure consistency with the inference process, we employ a supervised fine-tuning and generate prompt-response pairs from a given \\nlsql dataset. Specifically, given a \\nlsql data set $\\mathcal{T} = \\{(q_i, s_i, \\mathcal{D}_i)\\}$, we fine-tune the LLMs using the generated tuning data by using target question and the given database as prompt, and treating the desired query as response from LLM, i.e.,  $\\mathcal{T} = \\{(p_i = \\sigma(q_i, \\mathcal{D}_i), r_i = s_i)\\}$. \nOnce the data is ready, we can use existing package to fine-tune the given LLM $\\mathcal{M}$ through either full fine-tuning~\\cite{instructgpt} or parameter-efficient fine-tuning~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/HuSWALWWC22} depending on the available computational resources. After fine-tuning, the optimized LLM $\\mathcal{M}^*$ can be used to do inference, that is asking it to generate queries through natural language questions.\nNote that we utilize the same question representation $\\sigma$ in both fine-tuning and inference processes.\nWe will conduct a series of experiments and discuss the great potential of supervised fine-tuning for \\nlsql.\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\linewidth]{figures/openai_0shot_em.pdf}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\linewidth]{figures/openai_0shot_ex.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\revision{Results of different question representations on Spider-dev under zero-shot scenario.}}\n\t\\label{fig:openai_zero_shot}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering\n\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\linewidth]{figures/component_foreign_key_em.pdf}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\linewidth]{figures/component_foreign_key_ex.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\revision{Ablation studies of foreign keys information on Spider-dev.

presented in~\\secref{subsec:question_representation} under zero-shot scenario,  \\revision{employing four LLMs: \\gptfour, \\chatgpt, \\davinci, and \\vicuna}.\n\n\\figref{fig:openai_zero_shot} presents the comparison of different question representations over Spider-dev. \nBy comparing different representations, we can observe that \\abopenaiprompt fits to all \\revision{four} LLMs and achieves $75.5\\%$ execution accuracy with GPT-3.5-TURBO. \nIn contrast, \\abalpacaprompt exhibits poor performance with \\revision{\\chatgpt, \\davinci, and \\vicuna}, necessitating a suitable LLM to work well with.\nUnexpectedly, \\gptfour exhibits a preference for the simple \\abbsprompt derived from Din-SQL~\\cite{din-sql}, indicating that a powerful LLM can mitigate the complexities associated with representation design.\nBesides, by comparing the average performance for \\revision{four} LLMs, \\gptfour and \\chatgpt are more capable in the zero-shot scenario. \nDue to the expensive cost of \\gptfour, \\chatgpt together with \\abopenaiprompt maybe a better choice for the zero-shot scenario. \\revision{For less powerful LLMs like \\davinci and \\vicuna, \\abopenaiprompt and \\absqlprompt are preferred.}\nFor detailed numerical results, please refer to \\appref{app:prompt_spider}. \n\nTo further investigate the different question representations, we conduct ablation study to explore the effects of their invidual components. \n\n\\textbf{Foreign Key} (FK). \nForeign Key implies the relation among different relational tables, which might be helpful in \\nlsql task. \nIn our evaluation, only \\absqlprompt contains foreign key information. \nTo examine its effect, we add foreign key information into other representations and evaluate them in~\\figref{fig:openai_zero_shot_key}. \n\\revision{For OpenAI LLMs, we observe that foreign key significantly improves the execution accuracy of LLMs by $0.6\\%-2.9\\%$, except the combinations of \\abtextprompt with \\gptfour ($-0.2\\%$) and \\abalpacaprompt with \\davinci ($-0.4\\%$).} \\revision{However, the impact of foreign key for \\vicuna tends to be unstable. \nNotably, the inclusion of foreign keys leads to a surprising improvement of $5.0\\%$ for the \\abbsprompt, but adversely affects the performance of the \\abopenaiprompt and \\abalpacaprompt.}\n\n\\textbf{Rule Implication} (RI). \nInspired by the outperformance of \\abopenaiprompt, we explore the effect of rule implication. \nSpecifically, \\abopenaiprompt implicate LLMs to generate SQL queries ``\\textit{with no explanation}''\nTo examine the effect of ``\\textit{with no explanation}'' rule in question representation, we present an ablation study in \\figref{fig:openai_zero_shot_rule}. \n\\revision{Specifically, we plot the performance of different representations after including the ``\\textit{with no explanation}\" implication and the change of accuracy.}\nFrom~\\figref{fig:openai_zero_shot_rule} we observe adding this rule consistently booms the performance of all LLMs in both exact-set-match and execution accuracy, with the most significant improvements exceeding $6\\%$ and \\revision{$3\\%$}, respectively. \nWhile for \\abopenaiprompt, removing this rule incurs about $2.4\\%-6.2\\%$ drop in exact-set-match accuracy, and \\revision{$1.3\\%-2.4\\%$} drop in execution accuracy, indicating the importance of this rule implication. \nAs a comparison, we also test a popular rule implication ``\\textit{Let's think step by step}''~\\cite{kojima2022large}, which guides LLM to generate response with analysis.\nHowever, its performance is highly volatile in \\nlsql task as \\appref{app:step_by_step} shows. \nDue to limited resources, we leave the exploration of other possible rule implications as an open question for future research. \n\nIn summary, both the foreign key and the ``\\textit{with no explanation}'' implication rule are beneficial for \\nlsql task.\nIn our evaluation, \\abopenaiprompt with foreign keys and GPT-3.5-TURBO are the most effective and economic combination, which achieves $51.5\\%$ exact-set-match accuracy and $78.4\\%$ execution accuracy. \\subsection{In-Context Learning for \\nlsql}\n\\label{sec:chatgpt}\n\nIn few-shot scenario, we examine different example selection and organization strategies with \\revision{\\gptfour, \\chatgpt, \\davinci, and \\vicuna}. \nTo ensure a fair comparison, we adopt \\absqlprompt as the question representation for all the experiments in this subsection, due to its superior performance in one-shot preliminary experiment in~\\appref{app:prompt_spider_1shot}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[th]\n    \\centering\n

Spider-dev with different example organizations. The selection is fixed to DAIL Selection.}}\\label{fg:organization}\n    \\end{minipage}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsubsection{Example Selection}\nTo verify the importance of both question and query for example selection, we calculate question's and query's Jaccard similarities between chosen examples and the target instance, and report the averaged numbers under column \\emph{question similarity} and \\emph{query similarity} in~\\tabref{tab:kk_prompt_spider}. \nSpecifically, we remove database-specific information from questions~\\cite{rat-sql} and queries~\\cite{li2023resdsql}, and calculate the Jaccard similaritis of the remained tokens. \n\\revision{Besides, we introduce \\textbf{Upper Limit} for reference, which is similar with \\pqsselector but utilizes the ground truth query $s^*$ rather than the query generated by preliminary predictor. Notably, we do not directly provide the ground truth SQL to the LLMs, but just use the ground truth query as a reference for selecting examples.}\nTo some extent, Upper Limit indicates the upper bound of performance for similarity based selection methods. \n\n\\tabref{tab:kk_prompt_spider} shows the comparisons of different example selection strategies in 1-, 3- and 5-shot scenarios on Spider-dev.\nBy comparing different selection strategies, it is demonstrated that \\abpqsselector generally outperforms other strategies. \nIn 5-shot scenario, equipped with GPT-4, \\ours achieves $82.4\\%$ execution accuracy. \nBesides, in \\tabref{tab:kk_prompt_spider} we observe the increasing question and query similarity corresponds to higher execution accuracy mostly, indicating the importance of considering both question and query similarity. \nNote \\abpqsselector's execution accuracy is still lower than Upper Limit. \nThis discrepancy can be attributed to the lower query similarity, indicating the gap between the ground truth query and that generated by the preliminary model. \n\n\\subsubsection{Example Organization}\n\nTo compare different example organization strategies, we evaluate \\fiorg, \\sqlorg and \\pairorg in few-shot scenario on both Spider-dev and Spider-Realistic. \n\\figref{fg:organization} shows the comparison results, and refer to \\appref{app:exp_organization} for detailed numerical results. \n\nFrom \\figref{fg:organization:dev:gpt4} and \\figref{fg:organization:realistic:gpt4}, we can observe that \\gptfour benefits from contextual examples steadily on both Spider-dev and Spider-Realistic. \nWith \\pairorg, its execution accuracy increases from $72.3\\%$ to $83.5\\%$ on Spider-dev and from $66.5\\%$ to $76.0\\%$ on Spider-Realistic. \nWhile for \\chatgpt and \\davinci, adding examples may incur drop in execution accuracy due to limited in-context learning capability. \n\\revision{Regarding \\vicuna, its performance consistently improves as the number of examples increases in \\pairorg.}\nBy comparing different organization strategies, we observe that \\gptfour shows preference for \\pairorg in both Spider-dev and Spider-Realistic, suggesting it can effectively learn the mapping from question-SQL pairs. \nFor \\chatgpt (\\figref{fg:organization:dev:chatgpt} and \\figref{fg:organization:realistic:chatgpt}), compared with its zero-shot performance in \\figref{fig:openai_zero_shot}, its enhancement in in-context learning is the smallest among \\revision{four} LLMs, due to its weakness in in-context learning.\nFor \\davinci, \\fiorg is far beyond the other two strategies, especially with increasing example number, as depicted in~\\figref{fg:organization:dev:davinci} and \\figref{fg:organization:realistic:davinci}. \n\\revision{Figures \\ref{fg:organization:dev:vicuna} and \\ref{fg:organization:realistic:vicuna} illustrate that in the case of Vicuna-33B, \\pairorg outperforms \\sqlorg but falls short of the performance achieved by \\fiorg.}\nBy comparing different LLMs, we infer that for LLM with greater in-context learning capability, like GPT-4, benefits from \\pairorg the most, while the weaker LLMs require more information to learn from examples. \nHowever, we emphasize \\pairorg can be a good choice to achieve higher performance, and \nthe best execution accuracy in our evaluation is achieved by \\pairorg with GPT-4. \n\nIn summary, for example selection, our findings emphasize the importance of the mapping from question to SQL query. \nConsidering both question and query similarities simultaneously, \\abpqsselector outperforms other selection strategies in our evaluation. \nFor example organization, we show the effectiveness of \\abpairorg, and point out its demands for potent LLMs. \nFinally, in our evaluation, we observe that our approach, \\ours, equipped with GPT-4, achieves the highest performance with an execution accuracy of $83.5\\%$ on Spider-dev and $76.0\\%$ on Spider-Realistic. \\revision{For more comparisons with previous methods, please refer to

\nDue to the unaffordable cost of fine-tuning OpenAI LLMs, we focus on open-source LLMs. \nGiven the fact that very few existing work adopt open-source LLMs and their performance remain unknown, we first undertake a thorough evaluation for open-source LLMs, employing various question representation, example selection and organization strategies. \nAfter that, we fine-tune open-source LLMs in \\nlsql and observe their enhancement in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.\n\n\\subsubsection{Open-source LLM}\n\nTo investigate the potential of open-source LLM, we choose LLaMA~\\cite{llama}, and its aligned variants in varying scales. \nThey are detailed as follows. \nNote the aligned variants means the LLM is aligned to be more helpful, harmless and honest~\\cite{hhh}, \nand the suffix \"-7B\" means the LLM has 7 billions parameters, the same meaning for \"-13B\" and \"-33B\".\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{LLaMA-7B/13B/33B}~\\cite{llama} is a collection of widely recognized open-source LLMs, which are pre-trained on massive corpus by Meta.\n    \\item \\revision{\\textbf{Falcon-40B}~\\cite{penedo2023refinedweb} is pre-trained solely on massive corpus of refined web data.}\n\t\\item \\delete{\\textbf{Alpaca-7B}~\\cite{alpaca} is an aligned version of LLaMA-7B, which is fine-tuned with 52k instruction-following data generated by TEXT-DAVINCI-003.} \n\t\\item \\delete{\\textbf{GPT4ALL-7B}~\\cite{gpt4all} is another aligned version of LLaMA-7B with about 800k data designed for helpful, harmless and honest AI assistant.} \n    \\item \\textbf{LLaMA-2-CHAT-7B/13B\\revision{/70B}}~\\cite{llama2} are up-to-date version of LLaMA. \n    They are both pre-trained and aligned, and outperform the previous version on most benchmarks. \n\t\\item \\textbf{Vicuna-7/13/33B}~\\cite{vicuna, vicuna2023} is a collection of open-source chatbot aligned from LLaMA with user-shared conversations. \n    Vicuna-13B~\\cite{vicuna2023} is declared to perform similar to OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard, and outperforms LLaMA and Alpaca in most scenarios. \n        \\item \\revision{\\textbf{CodeLLaMA-34B}~\\cite{roziere2023code} is an aligned version of LLaMA-2-34B, which is fine-tuned with 500B tokens of code data.} \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection{Zero-shot Scenario with Open-source LLM}\n\n\\tabref{tab:0shot_spider_ss} shows their zero-shot performances on Spider-dev with different question representations. \nDue to limited space, please refer to \\appref{app:0shot_realistic_ss} for the performance on Spider-Realistic.\nNext, we provide several analysis from aspects of question representations, model scale and alignment as follows. \n\n\\textbf{Effect of Question Representation}. \n\\revision{We can observe that the best performances is achieved by \\absqlprompt with \\revision{$68.5\\%$} execution accuracy on Spider-dev. \n\\delete{The possible reason is that full database knowledge in \\absqlprompt (\\sqlprompt) compensates the incapability of open-source LLMs.}\nOne possible reason is that \\absqlprompt tends to stimulate the coding capability of LLMs. \nThis effect is particularly evident in CodeLLaMA-34B, which only achieve $40.3\\%$ execution accuracy with natural language-based \\abtextprompt.}\n\n\\textbf{Effect of Model Scale}.  \nFrom the results we observe a positive correlation  between model scale and performance on \\nlsql for both LLaMA and Vicuna. \nSpecifically, the average execution match accuracy of LLaMA shows a notable progression from $9.1\\%$ to $34.0\\%$ on Spider-dev, and Vicuna shows a similar upward trend from $15.3\\%$ to $36.6\\%$. \n\\revision{With the most parameter size, LLaMA-2-CHAT-70B improves the average performance to $39.6\\%$.} \nIn the more challenging dataset Spider-Realistic,\nthe same pattern can be observed and execution accuracy of LLaMA and Vicuna rise from  $7.56\\%$ to $25.4\\%$ and $12.3\\%$ to $30.0\\%$.\n\n\\textbf{Effect of Alignment}. \nFrom the results we observe that LLM alignment can benefit \\nlsql. \nSpecifically, with the same model scale, Vicuna outperforms LLaMA by about $5\\%$ in execution accuracy on both Spider-dev and Spider-Realistic. \n\\revision{For Falcon-40B, it performs poorly with all representations, attributable to the absence of dedicated code data in its training dataset. As a comparison, with carefully collected code data in the alignment stage, CodeLLaMA-34B exhibits a significant improvement in \\nlsql task with similar model scale. Note that, CodeLLaMA-34B also outperforms LLaMA-2-CHAT-70B by an average of $20.6\\%$ despite having only half the parameter of LLaMA-2-CHAT-70B. This highlights the crucial importance of the training corpus in LLMs.}\n\n\\revision{In conclusion, having more parameters in LLMs may hold certain potential benefits to \\nlsql, but the training corpus (e.g., having task-specific training data) plays a more crucial role.}\n\n\\subsubsection{Few-shot Scenario with Open-source LLM}\n\nFor few-shot scenario, \\figref{fig:kshot_llms} shows the performance of LLaMA-33B and Vicuna-33B with \\absqlprompt.\nWe use \\pqsselector to select example as it is reported as the best strategy in \\secref{sec:chatgpt}. \nFor more details, refer to \\appref{app:kshot_llms}. \nFrom this Figure, we can see that LLaMA-33B benefits more than Vicuna-33B, and achieves $36.4\\%$ exact-set-match accuracy with 5-shot \\fiorg examples. \nRegarding execution match accuracy, increasing number of examples benefits \\nlsql in most cases. \nBesides, among different organization strategies, \\fiorg outperforms other strategies in different k-shot scenarios, which achieves $51.5\\%$ execution accuracy with Vicuna-33B. \n\\revision{Please refer to \n\\appref{app:kshot_llms_size_and_corpus}\nfor more analysis in few-shot scenario.}\n\nNotably, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, the open-source LLMs are far behind OpenAI LLMs. \nWe will try to further enhance their performance with supervised fine-tuning.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/openllm_kshot.pdf}\n    \\caption{Few-shot evaluation with open-source LLMs on Spider-dev.}\n\t\\label{fig:kshot_llms}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[th]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\linewidth]{figures/openllm_sft_0shot_em.pdf}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\linewidth]{figures/openllm_sft_0shot_ex.pdf}\n\t\\caption{Zero-shot evaluation results on Spider-dev with different fine-tuned open-source LLMs.}\n\t\\label{fig:sft_each_prompt_spider}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsubsection{Supervised Fine-tuning with Open-source LLM}\n\nTo further enhance Open-source LLMs' performances, we explore supervised fine-tuning for \\nlsql. \nSimilar to in-context learning, it may prefer different representations. \nThus, we first fine-tune open-source LLMs on zero-shot training samples with different representations. \nFollowing the setting of supervised fine-tuning~\\cite{instructgpt, alpaca}, we block the gradients from prompt and only update weights with those from response (SQL queries). \nWe use the train split in Spider, which contains $8659$ training samples. \nFor more training details, please refer to \\appref{app:tuning_detail}.\n\n\\textbf{Zero-shot Scenario.}\n\\figref{fig:sft_each_prompt_spider} shows the performance of supervised fine-tuning with various LLMs and question representations in zero-shot scenario. \nCompared with zero-shot performance before fine-tuning in \\tabref{tab:0shot_spider_ss}\n, their performances are greatly enhanced. \nBy comparing different representations, \\alpacaprompt show obvious advantages in supervised fine-tuning as it is designed for such scenario.\n\nWe also observe the gap among different representations and model scales becomes narrow. \nThe possible reason is that after fine-tuning, \\revision{LLMs learn to answer new \\nlsql questions without task instruction and foreign keys.} \nIn this experiment, the best performance on Spider is achieved by the combination of LLaMA-13B and \\alpacaprompt, whose exact-set-match and execution accuracy are $65.1\\%$ and $68.6\\%$. \nFor more detailed numerical results, please refer to \\appref{app:sft_each_prompt}. \nAs for larger LLM, the combination of LLaMA-33B and \\sqlprompt achieves $69.1\\%$ execution accuracy and $65.9\\%$ exact-set-match accuracy. \nDue to the limited resources, we leave LLMs larger than 33B as our future work. \n\nIn summary, supervised fine-tuning is quite beneficial for open-source LLMs in \\nlsql. \nCompared with OpenAI LLMs, in zero-shot scenario, fine-tuned LLaMA-13B and 30B are comparable to TEXT-DAVINCI-003 and slightly weaker than GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-TURBO. \n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n    \\small\n    \\centering\n    \\tabcolsep=4.5pt\n\t\\begin{tabular}{ll cc cc cc

fine-tuning, an important issue is: \\textit{Can we continue to enhance the performance of open-source LLM by adding contextual examples?}\nTo answer this question, we evaluate fine-tuned LLaMA-7B and 13B with 0, 1, 3 and 5-shot prompts as shown in \\tabref{tab:fewshot_sft}. \nWe also add the evaluation results of original LLaMA-7B and 13B for clear comparison.\nUnexpectedly, the fine-tuned LLMs fail to learn from examples. \nSpecifically, adding contextual examples in test prompts incurs sudden decrease in both exact-set-match and execution match accuracy, and adding more examples is also unhelpful. \nA possible reason is that LLM overfits to zero-shot prompt, which makes examples unuseful.\n\nIn summary, open-source LLMs demonstrate significant potential for \\nlsql tasks, particularly in supervised fine-tuning. \nSpecifically, after fine-tuning, their performances are comparable to TEXT-DAVINCI-003 in zero-shot scenario. \nHowever, unlike OpenAI LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs

In light of this, our approach, \\ours, offers a compelling solution that combines high execution accuracy with improved token efficiency. This makes it highly practical and suitable for real-world applications.\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\nBased on our experiments, we can have some empirical insights and guidelines as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For question representation, \\sqlprompt and \\openaiprompt are recommended, and other information such as foreign key and rule implication can be very helpful. \n    \n    \\item For example selection, the similarities of both natural language question and SQL query are important. \n    These two similarities together are a good indicator for designing effective selection strategy.\n    \n    \\item For example organization, if the adopted LLM is powerful enough, like \\gptfour, presenting them question and SQL query pairs is an effective yet efficient choice. \n    Otherwise, presenting them full information examples is suggested. \n    \n    \\item \\revision{For open-source LLM, having more parameters in LLMs benefits to \\nlsql task, but the training corpus plays a more crucial role. Besides, supervised fine-tuning is necessary and has considerable potential in \\nlsql task.}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThere are also some limitations in this paper. \nDue to limited resources, we only test two rule implications, and the exploration of more rules can further benefit LLM-based \\nlsql solutions. \n\\revision{We fine-tune open-source LLMs with only the Spider training set, and additional \\nlsql data would further enhance LLMs.}\nBesides, the databases in Spider and Spider-Realistic may be not large enough, and we believe some new challenges in effectiveness and efficiency will emerge if there are a mass of tables in \\nlsql task.  \n\\revision{Furthermore, the current evaluation metric prioritizes correctness over efficiency, and promoting LLM to generate efficient SQL among correct alternatives remains an important, unexplored question.}\nWe will keep working on these limitations and open questions. \n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nIn this paper, we conduct a systematical study on LLM-based \\nlsql from aspects of \n\\revision{prompt engineering} and supervised fine-tuning. \nWe point out that existing in-context learning techniques for \\nlsql neglect the mapping between questions and queries, as well as the trade-off between example quality and quantity. \nTo address these issues, we proposed a new prompt engineering method, named \\ours, which refreshes the Spider leaderboard with $86.6\\%$ execution accuracy and ranks the first place. \nRegarding supervised fine-tuning, we demonstrate the great potentials of open-source LLMs for \\nlsql, underline the importance of \n\\revision{training corpus} and model scaling, and point out the degeneracy of in-context learning capability after fine-tuning. \nFurther, we conduct an observation over existing solutions in terms of \\revision{efficiency}, which indicates \\ours is much more efficient and emphasizes the importance of token efficiency in prompt engineering. \nAll of these are open challenges and opportunities for future study.\nWe hope that our work can provide a comprehensive study about \\nlsql, give some guidelines for real-world applications, and help people advance its frontiers. \n\n\\clearpage\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 2>\n\n<paper 3>\n\\title{MAC-SQL: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework for Text-to-SQL}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\\newcommand{\\eat}[1]{}\n\n\\definecolor{pythonblue}{rgb}{0.16,0.12,0.93}\n\\definecolor{cppgreen}{rgb}{0.16,0.42,0.16}\n\\definecolor{promptinsert}{HTML}{bfefff}\n\\definecolor{codehlcolor}{HTML}{ffec8b}\n\\definecolor{codehlcolor2}{HTML}{ffbbff}\n\\definecolor{bgcolor}{rgb}{0.95,0.95,0.92}\n\n\\lstdefinestyle{plain}{\n    basicstyle=\\fontsize{8}{7}\\ttfamily,\n    keywordstyle=\\color{blue},\n    commentstyle=\\color{gray},\n    stringstyle=\\color{green},\n    showstringspaces=false,\n    breaklines=true,\n    breakatwhitespace=false,\n    breakindent=0pt,\n    escapeinside={(*@}{@*)}\n}\n\n\\lstdefinestyle{sql}{\n    language=SQL,\n    basicstyle=\\fontsize{8}{7}\\ttfamily,\n    keywordstyle=\\color{black},\n    commentstyle=\\color{black},\n    stringstyle=\\color{black},\n    showstringspaces=false,\n    breakatwhitespace=false,\n    breaklines=true,\n    breakindent=0pt,\n    escapeinside={(*@}{@*)}\n}\n\n\\newcommand{\\inserthl}[1]{\\sethlcolor{promptinsert}\\hl{#1}}\n\\newcommand{\\codehl}[1]{\\sethlcolor{codehlcolor}\\hl{#1}}\n\\newcommand{\\codehlerr}[1]{\\sethlcolor{codehlcolor2}\\hl{#1}}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nRecent LLM-based Text-to-SQL methods usually suffer from significant performance degradation on ``huge\" databases and complex user questions that require multi-step reasoning. Moreover, most existing methods neglect the crucial significance of LLMs utilizing external tools and model collaboration. To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{\\texttt{MAC-SQL}}, a novel LLM-based multi-agent collaborative framework. Our framework comprises a core decomposer agent for Text-to-SQL generation with few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning, accompanied by two auxiliary agents that utilize external tools or models to acquire smaller sub-databases and refine erroneous SQL queries. The decomposer agent collaborates with auxiliary agents, which are activated as needed and can be expanded to accommodate new features or tools for effective Text-to-SQL parsing. In our framework, We initially leverage GPT-4 as the strong backbone LLM for all agent tasks to determine the upper bound of our framework. We then fine-tune an open-sourced instruction-followed model, SQL-Llama, by leveraging Code Llama 7B, to accomplish all tasks as GPT-4 does. Experiments show that SQL-Llama achieves a comparable execution accuracy of 43.94, compared to the baseline accuracy of 46.35 for vanilla GPT-4. At the time of writing, MAC-SQL+GPT-4 achieves an execution accuracy of 59.59 when evaluated on the BIRD benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on its holdout test set\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/wbbeyourself/MAC-SQL}}.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figures/intro.pdf}\n    \\caption{A complex example of Text-to-SQL.

In the initial phase, systems encode input sequence utilizing pre-trained models, and SQL queries are decoded using either abstract syntax trees~\\citep{xu2017sqlnet, guo2019complex, wang2021ratsql} or predefined sketches~\\citep{he2019xsql}. More recent systems~\\citep{raffel2023exploring,xie2022unifiedskg, scholak2021picard} have adopted sequence-to-sequence methodologies. \nThe latest research~\\citep{ouyang2022training,OpenAI2023GPT4TR,rozière2023code} has demonstrated the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this task. The success of these models can be ascribed to their emerging abilities~\\citep{wei2023chainofthought,brown2020language} and robust reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.99\\textwidth]{figures/mac-sql-framework.pdf}\n    \\caption{The overview of our \\ours{} framework, which comprises three agents: (i) the \\textit{Selector}, which decomposes a large database into a smaller sub-database to mitigate the interference of irrelevant information, and (ii) the \\textit{Decomposer}, which breaks down a complex question into simpler sub-questions and resolves them progressively by chain-of-thought reasoning, and (iii) the \\textit{Refiner}, which uses an external tool for SQL execution and obtains feedback, then refines faulty SQL queries.}\n    \\label{fig:framework}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nRecent research on LLM-based Text-to-SQL~\\citep{dong2023c3,pourreza2023dinsql,gao2023texttosql} has mainly concentrated on In-Context Learning prompt strategies and supervised fine-tuning using data derived from the target domain. \nHowever, these approaches usually suffer from significant performance degradation on “huge” databases and complex user questions that require multi-step reasoning, as demonstrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:intro-demo}. \nMoreover, most existing methods neglect the crucial significance of LLMs utilizing external tools and model collaboration.\n\nTo alleviate the above challenges, we introduce \\ours{}, a novel LLM-based multi-agent collaborative framework, which exploits LLMs as intelligent agents with different functionalities for effective Text-to-SQL parsing. \nOur framework comprises a core \\textit{Decomposer} agent for Text-to-SQL generation, accompanied by two auxiliary agents, the \\textit{Selector} and the \\textit{Refiner}, for tool usage and SQL refinement.\nSpecifically, the Decomposer breaks down a complex question into simpler sub-questions and resolves them progressively by chain-of-thought reasoning.\nWhen necessary, the Selector decomposes a large database into a smaller sub-database to minimize the interference of irrelevant information, while the Refiner employs an external tool for SQL execution, obtains feedback, and refines erroneous SQL queries.\n\nFurthermore, we have fine-tuned an instruction-followed model, SQL-Llama, by leveraging Code Llama 7B, using agent instruction data from \\ours{}, thus enabling capabilities in database simplification, question decomposition, SQL generation, and SQL correction. \n\nIn our experiments, we initially leverage GPT-4 as a strong backbone LLM for all agent tasks to determine the upper bound of our \\ours{} framework on the widely used BIRD and Spider dataset.\nExperimental results demonstrate that MAC-SQL+GPT-4 achieves an execution accuracy of 59.59 on the holdout test set of BIRD, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) at the time of writing.\nFurthermore, We utilize SQL-Llama(7B) to accomplish all tasks like GPT-4.\nSurprisingly, despite SQL-Llama having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than GPT-4, its execution accuracy reaches 43.94, which is remarkably close to the accuracy of GPT-4 (46.35).\n\n\\textbf{Contribution} Our main contributions and results are summarized as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item We propose \\ours{}, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework for Text-to-SQL, which integrates external tools and facilitates model collaboration to address intricate scenarios.\n    \\item We introduce an instruction-tuning model, named SQL-Llama, to fill in the gaps in open-source agent-instruction-following models for the task of Text-to-SQL.\n    \\item Experimental results demonstrate that \\ours{} achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy of 59.59\\% on the BIRD test set at the time of writing.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{Preliminaries}\n\n\\subsection{Problem Definition of Text-to-SQL}\n\nGiven a triple $\\mathcal{X}$ = $(\\mathcal{Q}, \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{K})$, where $\\mathcal{Q}$, $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{K}$ are natural language question, database schema and external knowledge (optional), the database schema $\\mathcal{S}$ is defined as $\\{\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{C}\\}$, where $\\mathcal{T}$ represents multiple tables $\\{\\mathcal{T}_{1},\\mathcal{T}_{2},\\dots,\\mathcal{T}_{|T|}\\}$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ represents columns $\\{\\mathcal{C}_{1},\\mathcal{C}_{2},\\dots,\\mathcal{C}_{|C|}\\}$. \nThe purpose of Text-to-SQL task is to generate the correct SQL $\\mathcal{Y}$ corresponding to the question $\\mathcal{Q}$. \n\n\\subsection{Large Language Model for Text-to-SQL}\n\nThe task of Text-to-SQL has been formulated as a generation task recently~\\cite{dong2023c3,pourreza2023dinsql}, designing appropriate prompts to guide a large language model $\\mathcal{M}$ generating SQL queries token by token. The generation process can be formulated as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nP_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\mathcal{Y} | \\mathcal{X}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{Y}|} P_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\mathcal{Y}_i | \\mathcal{Y}_{<i}; \\mathcal{X})\n\\label{eq:baset2s}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{Y}{<i}$ is the prefix of the SQL query $\\mathcal{Y}$ and $P_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\mathcal{Y}_i | \\cdot)$ is the conditional probability of the $i$-th token in the SQL query $\\mathcal{Y}$ given the prefix $\\mathcal{Y}_{<i}$ and the triple $\\mathcal{X}$ = $(\\mathcal{Q}, \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{K})$.\n\n\\begin{algorithm}[t]\n\\caption{The algorithm of MAC-SQL}\\label{alg:macsql}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\\Require \\texttt{question q}, \\texttt{database db}, \\texttt{knowledge kg} \n\\Ensure \\texttt{sql}\n\n\\If{need simplify to \\texttt{database}}\n    \\State \\texttt{db} = \\textcolor[HTML]{3078BE}{$\\mathrm{LLM_{Selector}}$}(\\texttt{q}, \\texttt{db}, \\texttt{kg})\n\\EndIf\n\n\\State \\texttt{dbDesc} = \\textcolor[HTML]{3078BE}{$\\mathrm{getDbRepresenation}$}(\\texttt{db}, \\texttt{kg})\n\\State \\texttt{subQs}, \\texttt{subSQLs} = \\textcolor[HTML]{3078BE}{$\\mathrm{LLM_{Decomposer}}$}(\\texttt{q}, \\texttt{dbDesc})\n\n\\State \\texttt{sql} = \\texttt{subSQLs[-1]}\n\\State \\texttt{count} = \\texttt{0}\n\\While{$\\texttt{count} < \\texttt{maxTryTimes}$}\n    \\State \\texttt{ok}, \\texttt{err} = \\textcolor[HTML]{3078BE}{$\\mathrm{executeAndAnalyze}$}(\\texttt{sql}, \\texttt{db})\n    \\If{\\texttt{ok}}\n        \\State \\Return \\texttt{sql}\n    \\Else\n        \\State \\texttt{sql} = \\textcolor[HTML]{3078BE}{$\\mathrm{LLM_{Refiner}}$}(\\texttt{q}, \\texttt{dbDesc}, \\texttt{sql}, \\texttt{err})\n    \\EndIf\n\\EndWhile\n\\State \\Return \\texttt{sql}\n\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\n\\section{MAC-SQL Framework}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\n\\subsection{Overview}\n\\label{sec:overview}\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:framework}, we introduce \\ours{}, a novel LLM-based multi-agent collaborative framework, which exploits LLMs as intelligent agents with different functionalities for effective Text-to-SQL parsing. \n\\ours{} comprises a core \\textit{Decomposer} agent for Text-to-SQL generation, accompanied by two auxiliary agents, the \\textit{Selector} and the \\textit{Refiner}, for tool usage and SQL refinement.\nIn Algorithm~\\ref{alg:macsql}, we present the collaboration process of three agents in \\ours{}. \nIn the following section, a detailed introduction of three agents will be presented.\n\n\\subsection{Selector}\n\\label{sec:selector}\n\nGiven an input triple $\\mathcal{X}$ = $(\\mathcal{Q}, \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{K})$, where database schema $\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{C}\\}$, the Selector agent aims to locate the minimal schema $\\mathcal{S^{'}} = \\{\\mathcal{T^{'}},\\mathcal{C^{'}}\\}$, where $T^{'} \\subseteq T$ and $C^{'} \\subseteq C$, to answer the question $\\mathcal{Q}$ with knowledge $\\mathcal{K}$. The function of the Selector agent can be described as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{S}^{'} = f_{selector}( \\mathcal{Q}, \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{K} | \\mathcal{M})\n\\label{eq:selector}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $f_{selector}( \\cdot | \\mathcal{M})$ denotes the function of the Selector by prompting the LLM $\\mathcal{M}$. \nThe motivation behind designing the selector primarily involves two key factors.\nFirstly, introducing too many irrelevant schema items in the prompt increases the likelihood of LLM generating irrelevant schema items in the output SQL. \nSecondly, using the complete database schema results in excessive text length, leading to unnecessary API costs, and may exceed the maximum context length of LLM.\nIt is important to note that the Selector will only be activated when the length of the database schema prompt exceeds the length threshold; otherwise, the original database schema $\\mathcal{S}$ will be used for the subsequent process.\nThe complete prompt of the Selector agent is shown in Appendix \\ref{fig:selector}.\n\n\\subsection{Decomposer}\n\\label{sec:decomposer}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figures/decomposer.pdf}\n    \\caption{The Decomposer Agent Illustration.}\n    \\label{fig:decomposer}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe purpose of the Decomposer is to enhance LLM's reasoning ability by generating a series of intermediate steps (i.e. sub-questions and SQLs) before predicting the final SQL.\nAs shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:decomposer}, the Decomposer instructs the LLM to decompose the original complex question $\\mathcal{Q}$ as the reasoning steps and gets the final SQL query $\\mathcal{Y}$ in a single pass.\nIt can be described as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\nP_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\mathcal{Y} | \\mathcal{Q}, \\mathcal{S}^{'}, \\mathcal{K}) = \\prod_{j=1}^{L} P_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\mathcal{Y}^{j} | \\mathcal{Y}^{<j}; \\mathcal{Q}^{j}, \\mathcal{S}^{'}, \\mathcal{K})\n\\label{eq:decomposer}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{Q}^{j}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}^{j}$ are the $j$-th sub-question and sub-SQL generated by the LLM $\\mathcal{M}$ given the previous sub-SQLs $\\mathcal{Y}^{<j}$, filtered database schema $\\mathcal{S}^{'}$ and knowledge $\\mathcal{K}$, $L$ is the number of sub-questions.\n\nThe Decomposer pattern can be approached in two prompting methods for text-to-SQL parsing: chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting~\\citep{wei2023chainofthought} and least-to-most prompting~\\citep{zhou2022least-to-most}.\nThe former involves generating thinking and reasoning once to obtain an answer, while the latter incurs higher computational costs to generate each SQL query due to the iterative process.\n\nDue to the inefficiency of the iterative method and the need to determine when to stop, we adopt the CoT approach to generate sub-questions and their corresponding SQL.\nThe specific implementation is as follows: dynamically judging the difficulty of the user's question, if it can be answered by a simple SQL query, then the SQL is generated directly. \nIf the question is more complex, the corresponding SQL is generated starting from the simplest sub-question, and then gradually broken down to obtain progressive sub-questions until the final SQL corresponding to the question is obtained. \nAdditionally, we leverage the few-shot approach to enhance LLM's understanding of instructions through in-context learning.\n\n\\subsection{Refiner}\n\\label{sec:refiner}\n\nThe primary function of the Refiner is to detect and automatically rectify SQL errors, as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:refiner}. \nIn a comprehensive multi-agent collaborative framework, particularly within the context of Text-to-SQL tasks, the Refiner is essential for the inspection and correction of generated answers. \nFor instance, in the ChatDev project~\\cite{qian2024chatdev}, intelligent agents are responsible for conducting overall and functional module testing in addition to overall architectural design and code writing for game software development tasks. \nSimilarly, in Text-to-SQL tasks, the Refiner can be used to make appropriate adjustments for the different datasets, database schemas, SQL generation styles, and specific inductive biases.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figures/refiner.pdf}\n    \\caption{The Refiner Agent Illustration.}\n    \\label{fig:refiner}\n\\end{figure}\n\nGiven a flawed SQL query $\\mathcal{Y}^{'}$ and the error message feedback $\\mathcal{E}$, obtaining from external SQL tools, the Refiner instructs the LLM $\\mathcal{M}$ to generate the correct SQL query $\\mathcal{Y}$.\nIt can be described as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{Y} = f_{refiner}( \\mathcal{E}, \\mathcal{Y}^{'}, \\mathcal{Q}, \\mathcal{S}^{'}, \\mathcal{K} | \\mathcal{M})\n\\label{eq:refiner}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $f_{refiner}( \\cdot | \\mathcal{M})$ denotes the function of the Refiner by prompting the LLM $\\mathcal{M}$. \n\nAs shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:framework}, upon receiving an SQL query, the Refiner diagnoses the SQL statement to assess its syntactic correctness, execution feasibility, and the retrieval of non-empty results from the database. \nIn general, the purpose of the Refiner is to achieve self-checking and self-correction of the model to enhance the overall framework's fault tolerance and accuracy.\nBy leveraging the Selector agent, there is a significant reduction in syntax errors, schema linking, and other simple errors. \n\n\\section{SQL-Llama Model}\n\n\\subsection{Instruction Dataset Construction}\n\nTo construct the Agent-Instruct dataset, we instruct the GPT-4 with the training set of the BIRD and Spider dataset through multi-agent tasks. \nWe collect the generated instruction data according to the level of difficulty and filter out those with incorrect SQL query output.\nFinally, the curated Agent-Instruct dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ with $N$ (N=3) instruction tasks, $\\mathcal{D} = \\{\\mathcal{D}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ contains 10,000 high-quality instruction data with 3 agent-instruction tasks, covering both BIRD and Spider dataset distribution. \n\n\\subsection{Multi-task Supervised Fine-tuning}\n\nOur research has been primarily focused on the development of open-source models within the \\ours{} framework, to achieve performance levels comparable to closed-source models like GPT-4. \nTo achieve this, we have put significant effort into preparing the data for model training and have open-sourced SQL-Llama, a model that has been fine-tuned using three intelligent agent instruction data. The SQL-Llama model, based on Code Llama 7B, has undergone supervised fine-tuning using agent instruction data from \\ours{}, which has enhanced its capabilities in database simplification, question decomposition, SQL generation, and SQL correction.\n\nGiven the Agent-Instruct dataset with $N$ (N=3) instruction tasks, $\\mathcal{D} = \\{\\mathcal{D}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, the LLM trained on $D$ can learn from these tasks and complete agent tasks. \nThe supervised fine-tuning process can be described as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\mathcal{L} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{Q},\\mathcal{S}^{i},\\mathcal{K},\\mathcal{Y}^{i} \\sim \\mathcal{D} } \\left[ \\log P(\\mathcal{Y}^{i} | \\mathcal{Q}, \\mathcal{S}^{i}, \\mathcal{K}; \\mathcal{M}) \\right]\n\\label{eq:sft}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}$ is the training objective of $N$ tasks, $\\mathcal{S}^{i}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}^{i}$ are the selected database schema and intermediate SQL query of the $i$-th task.\n\nOne of the key challenges we encountered during the model training process was balancing model complexity with performance. We had to carefully optimize the model architecture and parameters to ensure that it could effectively handle the complexities of database-related tasks while still maintaining high-performance levels. Additionally, ensuring the quality and relevance of the instruction dataset for training was crucial, as it directly impacted the model's performance.\n\nDespite these challenges, our work on instruction-tuned models represents a significant step towards democratizing access to high-performance language models for database-related tasks. By open-sourcing both the model and the instruction dataset, we aim to provide valuable resources for further research and development in this area, ultimately leading to more accessible and effective tools for database query processing and related tasks.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Experimental Setup}\n\\label{experiment_setup}\n\n\\paragraph{Datasets} \nThe Spider~\\citep{YuSpider2018} dataset is frequently employed for assessing the performance of text-to-SQL parsing across multiple databases, necessitating models to demonstrate adaptability to unfamiliar database structures. \nThe dataset comprises 7,000 question-query pairs in the training set and 1,034 pairs in the development set, encompassing 200 distinct databases and 138 domains. \nIn this study, we assess the efficacy of our framework on the Spider development set, as the test set is not accessible.\n\nThe BIRD~\\citep{li2023llm} dataset released by Alibaba DAMO Academy is a new benchmark for large-scale real databases, containing 95 large-scale databases and high-quality Text-SQL pairs, with a data storage volume of up to 33.4GB spanning 37 professional domains. Unlike Spider, BIRD focuses on massive and real database content, external knowledge reasoning between natural language questions and database content, and new challenges in SQL efficiency when dealing with large databases.\n\n\\paragraph{Evaluation Metrics}\n\nFollowing BIRD~\\citep{li2023llm} and Test-suite~\\citep{zhong-etal-2020-semantic}, we consider three metrics, exact match accuracy (EM), execution accuracy (EX) and valid efficiency score (VES) to evaluate text-to-SQL models confronted with real-world scenarios with large database contents. \n\\textit{Exact Match Accuracy (EM)} treats each clause as a set and compares the prediction for each clause to its corresponding clause in the reference query. A predicted SQL query is considered correct only if all of its components match the ground truth. This metric does not take values into account. \n\\textit{Execution Accuracy (EX)} is defined as the proportion of questions in the evaluation set for which the execution results of both the predicted and ground-truth inquiries are identical, relative to the overall number of queries. \n\\textit{Valid Efficiency Score (VES)} is designed to measure the efficiency of valid SQLs generated by models. It is important to note that \"valid SQLs\" refers to predicted SQL queries whose result sets align with those of the ground-truth SQLs.\n\n\\paragraph{Baselines} We conduct experiments on both BIRD and Spider datasets and compare our method with the following baseline:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{GPT-4}~\\citep{OpenAI2023GPT4TR} uses simple zero-shot text-to-SQL prompt for SQL generation.\n    \\item \\textbf{DIN-SQL}~\\citep{pourreza2023dinsql} decomposes the text-to-SQL task into smaller subtasks and designs different prompts for each subtask to instruct GPT-4  to complete each subtask and obtain the final SQL.\n    \\item \\textbf{DAIL-SQL}~\\citep{gao2023texttosql} encodes structure knowledge as SQL statements, selects few-shot demonstrations based on their skeleton similarities and removes cross-domain knowledge from examples for token efficiency.\n    \\item \\textbf{C3-SQL}~\\citep{dong2023c3} first performs schema linking filtering and then directs GPT-4 with a calibration bias prompt designed for Spider using a self-consistency strategy.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Overall Performance}\n\n\\begin{table}[]\n\\small\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}\n\\toprule\n  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{Dev}} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{Test}} \\\\ \\cmidrule(l){2-5} \n\\multirow{-2}{*}{\\textbf{Method}}               & \\textbf{EX}    & \\textbf{VES}    & \\textbf{EX}     & \\textbf{VES}    \\\\ \n\n\\midrule\n\nPalm-2                                          & 27.38          & -               & 33.04           & -              \\\\\nChatGPT + CoT                                    & 36.64          & 42.30           & 40.08           & 56.56          \\\\\nClaude-2                                        & 42.70          & -               & 49.02           & -              \\\\\nGPT-4                                           & 46.35          & 49.77           & 54.89           & 60.77           \\\\\nDIN-SQL + GPT-4                                 & 50.72          & 58.79           & 55.90           & 59.44           \\\\\nDAIL-SQL + GPT-4                                & 54.76          & 56.08           & 57.41           & 61.95           \\\\  \n\n\\midrule\n\nSQL-Llama(7B)                     & 32.87          & 55.67           & -  & -  \\\\ \n\\ours{} + SQL-Llama(7B)           & 43.94          & 57.36           & -  & -  \\\\ \n\\quad + Oracle Schema         & 51.43          & 58.24           & -  & -  \\\\ \n\\ours{} + GPT-3.5-Turbo       & 50.56          & 61.25           & -  & -  \\\\ \n\\quad + Oracle Schema         & 65.78         & 60.62           & -  & -  \\\\ \n\\MAC                  & \\textbf{59.39}  & \\textbf{66.39} & \\textbf{59.59}  & \\textbf{67.68}  \\\\ \n\\quad + Oracle Schema         & 70.28          & 62.63           & -  & -  \\\\ \n\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Execution accuracy(EX) and Valid efficiency score (VES) on both dev and test set of BIRD dataset.

However, \"Schema Linking Error\" is more frequent in BIRD (2\\%) than in Spider (8\\%), demonstrating differences in schema linking errors.\nThis analysis underscores the need for addressing gold standard annotations, semantic correctness, and schema linking in dataset development and evaluation, thereby improving their quality and reliability. \nThe appendix \\ref{sec:error-examples} contains detailed examples of error types.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\paragraph{LLMs for Text-to-SQL} \n\nRecent advancements in text-to-SQL tasks using large language models (LLMs) have focused on improving prompt design and developing multi-stage refined frameworks. \nIn the early stages of the emergence of large language models, research efforts were primarily focused on designing high-quality prompts to better exploit the potential of LLMs for SQL generation. \nFor example, \\citep{tai2023exploring} systematically studied how to enhance LLMs' reasoning ability through chain-of-thought style prompting, including the original chain-of-thought prompting and least-to-most prompting. \nSimilarly, ~\\citep{chang2023prompt} comprehensively investigated the impact of prompt constructions across various settings when constructing the prompt text for text-to-SQL inputs. \nAdditionally, DAIL-SQL~\\citep{gao2023texttosql} systematically examined prompt engineering for LLM-based Text-to-SQL methods, including question representations, prompt components, example selections, and example organizations.\nLater studies, like C3-SQL~\\citep{dong2023c3}, DIN-SQL~\\citep{pourreza2023dinsql}, and StructGPT~\\citep{jiang2023structgpt}, proposed frameworks for simplifying databases, generating SQL, verifying queries, and integrating answers through zero-shot approaches, query decomposition, and specialized interfaces for structured data access.\n\nHowever, the aforementioned methods have several issues. \nFirstly, the experiments were conducted solely on the Spider family dataset, failing to demonstrate their generalization to more complex datasets like BIRD, hence limiting their real-world applicability. \nSecondly, certain methods depend on difficulty-level classifiers and customized biases specific to the Spider dataset for error correction, thus lacking the ability to generalize to a broader spectrum of error types.\nThirdly, these methods neglect the utilization of external tools and the collaboration of different modules.\nThus, we propose a framework centered on multi-agent collaboration that can be utilized for more intricate data scenarios and a broader spectrum of error types for detection and correction.\n\n\\paragraph{LLM-based Agents} LLM-based agents have been a prominent area of study in both academic and industry communities for an extended period~\\citep{wang2023survey}. \nRecently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. \nThis development has led to a surge in research exploring autonomous agents based on LLMs.\nAutoGPT~\\citep{autogpt2023} is an open-source implementation of an AI agent and follows a single-agent paradigm in which it augments the AI model with many useful tools, and does not support multi-agent collaboration.\nSimilarly, OpenAgents~\\citep{OpenAgents} develops three distinct agents, the Data Agent for data analysis, the Plugins Agent for plugin integration, and the Web Agent for autonomous web browsing, each specializing in different domains, similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT Plugins.\nAdditionally, AutoGen~\\citep{wu2023autogen} is an open-source framework that enables developers to build customizable, conversable agents that can operate in various modes, employing combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools to accomplish tasks.\nHowever, how to apply LLM-based agents to Text-to-SQL parsing remains under-explored.\n\nWe fill this gap by proposing a multi-agent collaborative Text-to-SQL framework, which integrates multiple LLM-based agents to collectively interpret SQL queries and address the complexity and diversity of SQL queries encountered in real-world scenarios.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIn summary, this paper proposes the \\ours{} framework, which utilizes multi-agent collaboration to address challenges in Text-to-SQL tasks. \nThe framework, along with the open-sourced SQL-Llama model, achieved an execution accuracy of 59.59 when evaluated on the BIRD benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on its holdout test set. \nThis work presents a novel approach to Text-to-SQL and provides practical guidance for achieving high performance in this domain.\nFurthermore, our framework can be expanded to support a broader spectrum of scenarios.\n\n\\section*{Limitations}\nThere are two limitations of our work. Firstly, we did not extensively engineer the prompts, which may not be optimal. Secondly, this paper reports the fine-tuning results of the 7B CodeLLama model.

This task, known as Text-to-SQL, has been approached through various methodologies, including rule-based systems, supervised learning models, and more recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) under zero-shot and few-shot prompting. The evolution of these systems has seen improvements in handling diverse and complex queries, but significant challenges remain, particularly in dealing with intricate database schemas and complex user questions that necessitate multi-step reasoning. Additionally, the utilization of external tools and model collaboration to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of generated SQL queries has not been extensively explored.\n\nRecent advancements in LLMs have shown promising results in Text-to-SQL tasks, with models like GPT-4 and CodeX demonstrating strong baselines using few-shot prompting. However, these models often struggle with complex queries and schema linking, leading to performance disparities compared to fine-tuned models. This paper provides a summary of three research papers that explore novel approaches to improve the performance of LLMs in Text-to-SQL tasks. The first paper, \"DIN-SQL: Decomposed In-Context Learning of Text-to-SQL with Self-Correction,\" introduces a method that decomposes the task into smaller sub-tasks and utilizes self-correction techniques. The second paper, \"MAC-SQL: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework for Text-to-SQL,\" proposes a multi-agent framework that integrates external tools and facilitates model collaboration. The third paper, \"NL-SQL Empowered by Large Language Models: A Benchmark Evaluation,\" evaluates various prompt engineering strategies and explores the potential of open-source LLMs for Text-to-SQL tasks. \n\nThe field of Text-to-SQL has seen significant progress, but challenges remain in achieving high accuracy and efficiency, especially for complex and large-scale databases. This summary aims to highlight the contributions and findings of these papers, providing insights into the current state of LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems and suggesting future research directions.\n\n### Main Content of Each Paper\n\n#### DIN-SQL: Decomposed In-Context Learning of Text-to-SQL with Self-Correction\n\nDIN-SQL proposes a novel method to enhance the performance of LLMs in Text-to-SQL tasks by decomposing the task into smaller sub-tasks. The approach is designed to address the shortcomings of LLMs in handling complex queries and schema linking, which are common failure points in few-shot prompting. The method consists of four main modules: schema linking, query classification and decomposition, SQL generation, and self-correction. Each module is implemented using prompting techniques, with the schema linking module identifying references to database schema and condition values in natural language queries, the classification and decomposition module categorizing queries into different classes based on complexity, and the SQL generation module generating SQL queries based on the identified classes. The self-correction module is used to fix minor errors in the generated SQL queries, such as missing or redundant keywords, through zero-shot prompting.\n\nThe schema linking module is crucial for identifying relevant database tables and columns, and it often fails when there is ambiguity in the question or schema. The query classification and decomposition module categorizes queries into three classes: easy, non-nested complex, and nested complex, with each class having a different prompting strategy. The SQL generation module uses different prompts for each class, with the non-nested complex class using an intermediate representation (NatSQL) to bridge the gap between natural language questions and SQL statements. The nested complex class requires multiple intermediate steps before generating the final answer. The self-correction module addresses common errors in SQL queries, such as missing or redundant keywords, by prompting the LLM to correct these issues.\n\nThe authors evaluate their method on the Spider and BIRD datasets, which are cross-domain benchmarks for Text-to-SQL tasks. On the Spider dataset, DIN-SQL achieves an execution accuracy of 85.3\\% using GPT-4, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) of 79.9\\%. On the BIRD dataset, the method achieves an execution accuracy of 55.9\\%, setting a new SOTA. The authors also conduct an ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of each module, showing that excluding any module leads to a decrease in performance. The study highlights the importance of schema linking, query decomposition, and self-correction in improving the accuracy of generated SQL queries.\n\n#### MAC-SQL: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework for Text-to-SQL\n\nMAC-SQL introduces a multi-agent collaborative framework to address the challenges of Text-to-SQL tasks, particularly in handling complex questions and large databases. The framework comprises three agents: the Selector, the Decomposer, and the Refiner. The Selector agent simplifies the database schema by filtering out irrelevant tables and columns, reducing the likelihood of generating incorrect SQL queries. The Decomposer agent breaks down complex questions into simpler sub-questions, generating intermediate SQL queries through chain-of-thought reasoning. The Refiner agent uses external SQL tools to execute and analyze generated SQL queries, refining them to ensure correctness and efficiency.\n\nThe Selector agent is activated when the database schema exceeds a certain length threshold, minimizing the interference of irrelevant information. The Decomposer agent generates a series of sub-questions and SQL queries, progressively refining the final SQL query. The Refiner agent detects and corrects errors in generated SQL queries, enhancing the overall accuracy and efficiency of the framework. The authors fine-tune an open-source model, SQL-Llama, based on Code Llama 7B, to perform the tasks of the three agents. SQL-Llama is trained using a curated dataset of 10,000 high-quality instruction data, covering both the Spider and BIRD datasets. The model is designed to handle database simplification, question decomposition, SQL generation, and SQL correction.\n\nThe authors evaluate their framework on the BIRD and Spider datasets, demonstrating that MAC-SQL achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both datasets. On the BIRD dataset, MAC-SQL+GPT-4 achieves an execution accuracy of 59.59\\%, surpassing the previous SOTA of 55.9\\%. On the Spider dataset, the framework achieves an execution accuracy of 86.75\\%, setting a new SOTA. The authors also conduct an ablation study, showing that each component (Selector, Decomposer, and Refiner) plays a crucial role in achieving high accuracy. The study highlights the importance of multi-agent collaboration in addressing the complexities and diversity of SQL queries encountered in real-world scenarios.\n\n#### NL-SQL Empowered by Large Language Models: A Benchmark Evaluation\n\nThis paper conducts a systematic evaluation of various prompt engineering strategies for LLM-based Text-to-SQL methods, including question representation, example selection, and example organization. The authors explore the potential of open-source LLMs for Text-to-SQL tasks and highlight the importance of token efficiency in prompt engineering. The evaluation is conducted on the Spider and BIRD datasets, which are widely recognized benchmarks for Text-to-SQL tasks.\n\nThe authors first evaluate different question representations under zero-shot scenario, including \\bsprompt, \\textprompt, \\openaiprompt, \\sqlprompt, and \\alpacaprompt. They find that \\openaiprompt and \\sqlprompt achieve the highest execution accuracy, with \\openaiprompt being more efficient in terms of token usage. The authors also conduct ablation studies to examine the effects of individual components in question representations, such as foreign key information and rule implications. They observe that foreign key information and rule implications significantly improve the performance of LLMs in Text-to-SQL tasks.\n\nFor in-context learning, the authors evaluate different example selection and organization strategies, including random selection, question similarity selection, masked question similarity selection, and DAIL selection. They find that DAIL selection, which considers both question and query similarities, outperforms other strategies. For example organization, the authors compare \\fiorg, \\sqlorg, and \\pairorg, finding that \\pairorg is the most effective strategy for powerful LLMs like GPT-4, while \\fiorg is preferred for weaker LLMs. The authors also explore the potential of open-source LLMs for Text-to-SQL tasks, fine-tuning them on the Spider training set and evaluating their performance on the development and test sets. They observe that open-source LLMs can achieve comparable performance to closed-source models like GPT-4 after fine-tuning, but their in-context learning capability may degrade.\n\nThe authors propose a new integrated solution, named \\ours, which combines the best practices from their evaluations. \\ours utilizes \\sqlprompt as the question representation, employs DAIL selection for example selection, and organizes examples in \\pairorg. The authors evaluate \\ours on the Spider and BIRD datasets, achieving SOTA performance on both. On the Spider dataset, \\ours achieves 86.6\\% execution accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA of 85.3\\%. On the BIRD dataset, \\ours achieves 83.5\\% execution accuracy, setting a new SOTA.\n\n### Commonalities and Innovations\n\nAll three papers focus on improving the performance of LLMs in Text-to-SQL tasks through novel prompting strategies and frameworks.
