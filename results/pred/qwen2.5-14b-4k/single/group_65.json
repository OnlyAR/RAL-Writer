Notably, OpenAI's ChatGPT stands out as a prominent example. Leveraging extensive pre-training on vast amounts of internet data and further fine-tuning with detailed instruction data~\\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/Ouyang0JAWMZASR22}, these models have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot performance across diverse tasks. This trend is also observed in the domain of code understanding and generation. Numerous Code LLMs~\\cite{li2023starcoder,AlphaCode,codegen,CodeGeeX,incoder,codex,codet5,CodeT5+} have been proposed to tackle the challenges associated with code-related tasks. These Code LLMs undergo pre-training using substantial amounts of code data, enabling them to excel in various code-related tasks, showcasing impressive performance.\n\nIn contrast to most previous Code LLMs that primarily emphasize the pre-training process, there has been limited exploration of fine-grained instruction tuning in the Code domain. The introduction of instruction tuning initially aimed to enhance the generalization capabilities of LMs across different tasks~\\cite{t5,DBLP:conf/iclr/WeiBZGYLDDL22,flan-t5,ExT5,T0,ZeroPrompt,UnifiedQA}. OpenAI's InstructGPT~\\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/Ouyang0JAWMZASR22}, for instance, involved soliciting human annotators to provide explicit instructions to ensure alignment with users' intentions. Similarly, recent works such as Alpaca~\\cite{alpaca} employed the self-instruct~\\cite{wang2022self} method, where ChatGPT generated the instruction data. Vicuna~\\cite{vicuna2023} utilized user-shared conversations collected from ShareGPT.com. WizardLM~\\cite{xu2023wizardlm} introduced the \\name{} method, which involved evolving existing instruction data to generate more complex and diverse datasets. However, it is worth noting that all these approaches primarily focused on the general domain and lacked specific design considerations for the code domain.\n\nMotivated by the \\name{} method, this study aims to enhance the capabilities of the SOTA open-source Code LLM, StarCoder~\\cite{li2023starcoder}, by generating intricate code instruction data through code-specific \\name{}. To achieve this, we have made several adaptations to the evolutionary prompt process tailored specifically for code-related tasks. These modifications include refining the evolutionary instructions, simplifying the form of evolutionary prompts, and incorporating code debugging and time-space complexity constraints. Initially, our method is applied to evolve the basic code instruction data, Code Alpaca~\\cite{codealpaca}. Subsequently, we conduct fine-tuning of StarCoder using our newly created code instruction-following training set and obtain our \\modelname{}.\n\nThe experimental results obtained from four code generation benchmarks, namely HumanEval~\\cite{humeval}, HumanEval+~\\cite{humanevalp}, MBPP~\\cite{MBPP}, and DS-100~\\cite{DS1000}, demonstrate that our \\modelname{} outperforms all other open-source Code LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Specifically, we observe a substantial improvement in pass@1 scores, with an increase of +22.3 (57.3 vs. 35.0) in HumanEval and +8.2 (51.8 vs. 43.6) in MBPP. Remarkably, despite its much smaller size, our \\modelname{} even surpasses Anthropic's Claude and Google's Bard in terms of pass rates on HumanEval and HumanEval+.\n\nThe contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We introduce \\modelname{}, which enhances the performance of the open-source Code LLM, StarCoder, through the application of Code \\name{}.\n    \\item \\modelname{} surpasses all other open-source Code LLMs by a substantial margin in terms of code generation, including StarCoder, CodeGen, CodeGee, CodeT5+, InstructCodeT5+, StarCoder-GPTeacher, and Instruct-Codegen-16B.\n    \\item \\modelname{} achieves superior results in code generation compared to the largest closed-source LLMs, such as Claude, Bard, PaLM, PaLM-2, and LaMDA, despite being considerably smaller in size.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\paragraph{Large Language Models.} Recently, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable achievements across a broad spectrum of tasks. Prominent tech companies have made significant strides in developing highly proficient LLMs. These include OpenAI's GPT3\\&4~\\cite{GPT3,GPT4}, Google's PaLM~\\cite{PaLM,palm2}, and Bard\\footnote{\\url{https://bard.google.com/}}, DeepMind's Chinchilla~\\cite{Chinchilla}, and Gopher~\\cite{gopher}, as well as Anthropic's Claude\\footnote{\\url{https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude}}. However, it is important to note that these models are closed-source and can only be accessed through specific APIs or may not be accessible at all.\n\nThe AI community has witnessed the release of several open-source LLMs, where the model weights are made publicly available. EleutherAI has contributed GPT-NeoX-20B~\\cite{GPT-NeoX-20B} and GPT-J-6B~\\cite{gpt-j}. Google has released UL2-20B~\\cite{UL2}. Tsinghua University has introduced GLM-130B~\\cite{GLM-130B}. Meta has released OPT~\\cite{opt} and LLaMA~\\cite{llama}. It is worth noting that while these open-source models have made valuable contributions, they generally do not exhibit the same level of performance as their closed-source counterparts.\n\n\\paragraph{Large Language Models for Code.} Recent studies have introduced a significant number of LLMs for code-related tasks to address the challenges of code understanding and generation. OpenAI has unveiled Codex~\\cite{codex} and Code-Davinci~\\cite{Azure}. Google has proposed PaLM-Coder~\\cite{PaLM}. They perform outstandingly on the popular code completion benchmarks, like HumanEval~\\cite{humeval} and MBPP~\\cite{MBPP}. However, these models are closed-source. \n\nOn the other hand, there are several open-source Code LLMs available. Salesforce has introduced CodeGen~\\cite{codegen}, CodeT5~\\cite{codet5}, and CodeT5+~\\cite{CodeT5+}. Tsinghua University has contributed CodeGeeX~\\cite{CodeGeeX}, and the BigCode Project has developed StarCoder~\\cite{li2023starcoder}. These models have demonstrated notable advancements in code-related tasks. However, when compared to the SOTA closed-source models, they still lag behind significantly. In contrast to the aforementioned models without instruction fine-tuning, our work demonstrates that further training Code LLMs with Code \\name{} can substantially enhance performance.\n\n\\paragraph{Instruction Fine-Tuning.} \n\nThe primary objective of instruction fine-tuning in its early stages was to enhance the cross-task generalization capabilities of LMs. This was achieved by fine-tuning LMs with a substantial corpus of public NLP tasks. T5~\\cite{t5} was among the first models to explore this approach, training on a multitude of supervised text-to-text tasks. Subsequent works such as FLAN~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/WeiBZGYLDDL22}, ExT5~\\cite{ExT5}, T0~\\cite{T0}, and UnifiedQA~\\cite{UnifiedQA} further expanded the range of tasks to bolster the overall generalization ability of LMs. Notably, ZeroPrompt~\\cite{ZeroPrompt} and FLAN-T5~\\cite{flan-t5} pushed the envelope by incorporating thousands of tasks in their training pipelines. Across these studies, a consistent finding emerges: fine-tuning LMs with diverse NLP task instructions yields significant performance improvements when applied to new tasks.\n\nWhile fine-tuning LMs with diverse NLP tasks has shown promising results, it often falls short in aligning with the intentions of real-world users. OpenAI has pursued a different approach by soliciting human annotators to provide a large corpus of human instructions, encompassing diverse forms and a wide range of task types. Building upon this dataset, OpenAI trained its GPT3~\\cite{GPT3} model to create InstructGPT~\\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/Ouyang0JAWMZASR22}, which better aligns with users' inputs. This line of development has even led to the impressive work known as ChatGPT. However, it is important to note that the dataset and model weights associated with these advancements are not publicly available. Alpaca~\\cite{alpaca} takes a different route by adopting the self-instruct method~\\cite{wang2022self}, leveraging ChatGPT to generate data for training. Vicuna~\\cite{vicuna2023} utilizes user-shared conversations collected from ShareGPT.com to train its models. WizardLM~\\cite{xu2023wizardlm} introduces the \\name{} method, which involves evolving existing instruction data to generate more complex and diverse datasets. In contrast to these general instruction fine-tuning approaches, our \\modelname{} successfully applies the \\name{} method specifically in the domain of Code LLMs.\\section{Approach}\nIn this section, we elaborate on the methodological details of \\modelname{}. Following WizardLM, we apply the \\name{} method to evolve Code Alpaca generated using self-instruct and fine-tune the pre-trained Code LLM StarCoder with the evolved data. \n\n\\subsection{Evol-Instruct Prompts for Code}\nInspired by the Evol-Instruct~\\cite{xu2023wizardlm} method proposed by WizardLM, this work also attempts to make code instructions more complex to enhance the fine-tuning effectiveness of code pre-trained large models. To adapt Evol-Instruct to the realm of code, we made the following modifications to the evolutionary prompt:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Streamlined the evolutionary instructions by removing deepening, complicating input, and In-Breadth Evolving.\n\\item Simplified the form of evolutionary prompts by unifying the evolutionary prompt template.\n\\item Addressing the specific characteristics of the code domain, we added two evolutionary instructions: code debugging and code time-space complexity constraints.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe unified code evolutionary prompt template is as follows:\n\\begin{boxEnv}\n\\texttt{Please increase the difficulty of the given programming test question a bit. \\\\\\\\You can increase the difficulty using, but not limited to, the following methods:\\\\ \\{method\\}\\\\\\\\ \\{question\\}}\n\\end{boxEnv}\nHere, $\\{$question$\\}$ represents the current code instruction awaiting evolution, and $\\{$method$\\}$ is the type of evolution. The five types we used are listed as follows:\n\\begin{boxEnv}\n\\texttt{Add new constraints and requirements to the original problem, adding approximately 10 additional words.\\\\\\\\Replace a commonly used requirement in the programming task with a less common and more specific one.\\\\\\\\If the original problem can be solved with only a few logical steps, please add more reasoning steps.\\\\\\\\Provide a piece of erroneous code as a reference to increase misdirection.\\\\\\\\Propose higher time or space complexity requirements, but please refrain from doing so frequently.}\n\\end{boxEnv}\n\n\\subsection{Training \\modelname{}}\nWe employ the following procedure to train \\modelname{}. Initially, we utilize StarCoder 15B~\\cite{li2023starcoder} as the foundation and proceed to fine-tune it using the code instruction-following training set, which was evolved through \\name{}. The prompt format for fine-tuning is outlined as follows:\n\\begin{boxEnv}\n\\texttt{Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. \\\\\\\\\\#\\#\\# Instruction:\\\\ \\{instruction\\}\\\\ \\\\\\#\\#\\# Response:}\n\\end{boxEnv}\nTo construct the training dataset, we initialized it with the 20K instruction-following dataset called Code Alpaca\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/sahil280114/codealpaca}}. We iteratively employ the Evol-Instruct technique on this dataset consisting of 20,000 samples to produce evolved data. After each round of data evolution, we merge the evolved data from all previous rounds with the original dataset to finetune StarCoder and assess the pass@1 metric on HumanEval~\\cite{humeval}. Once we observe a decline in the pass@1 metric, we will discontinue the usage of Evol-Instruct and choose the model with the highest pass@1 as the ultimate model.\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n     \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Coder_Figures/pass1.pdf}\n     \\caption{The percentage of pass rates on the HumanEval (164 problems) with a single attempt. All baseline scores are retrieved from the LLM-Humaneval-Benchmarks~\\cite{llm-humaneval-benchmarks}. Our \\modelname{} generates an answer with greedy decoding.}\n     \\label{fig:pass1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Experiment}\n\nThis section begins by providing a comprehensive overview of the baseline models in our experiments. Subsequently, we present the performance of our models on four code generation benchmarks: HumanEval~\\cite{humeval}, HumanEval+~\\cite{humanevalp}, MBPP~\\cite{MBPP}, and DS-1000~\\cite{DS1000}.\n\n\\subsection{Baselines}\n\n\\paragraph{Closed-Source Models.} Multiple technology companies have successfully developed highly proficient LLMs while choosing not to publicly release them. These models are referred to as closed-source models. For our research, we incorporate a substantial number of these models as our baselines. Specifically, our baselines encompass the following: (i) OpenAI's GPT3.5\\&4~\\cite{GPT4}, Code-Davinci-002~\\cite{Azure}, Code-Cushman-001~\\cite{Azure}, and Codex~\\cite{codex}; (ii) Google's Bard, PaLM 2~\\cite{palm2}, PaLM~\\cite{PaLM}, and LaMDA~\\cite{LaMDA}; (iii) Google DeepMind's AlphaCode~\\cite{AlphaCode}; and (iv) Anthropic's Claude.\n\n\\paragraph{Open-Source Models.} Several open-source LLMs have been made available to the AI community, although their performance generally lags behind the closed-source models a lot. As part of our research, we incorporate a significant number of these open-source models as our baselines. Our baselines encompass the following models: StarCoder~\\cite{li2023starcoder}, LLaMa~\\cite{llama}, CodeGen~\\cite{codegen}, CodeGeeX~\\cite{CodeGeeX}, CodeT5+\\cite{CodeT5+}, and InCoder\\cite{incoder}. In addition, we also include several models with instructions fine-tuning, including StarCoder-GPTeacher,\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/GeorgiaTechResearchInstitute/starcoder-gpteacher-code-instruct}} Instruct-Codegen-16B,\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/sahil2801/instruct-codegen-16B}} Guanaco-65B,\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/guanaco-65B-HF}} and Falcon-40B-Instruct.\\footnote{\\url{https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct}}\n\n\\subsection{Implementation Details}\n\nThe StarCoder~\\cite{li2023starcoder} serves as our basic foundation model. The evolved dataset consists of approximately 78k samples. To fine-tune the basic models, we employ specific configurations, including a batch size of 512, a sequence length of 2048, 200 fine-tuning steps, 30 warmup steps, a learning rate of 2e-5, a Cosine learning rate scheduler, and fp16 mixed precision.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation on HumanEval, HumanEval+, and MBPP}\n\nHumanEval~\\cite{humeval}, HumanEval+~\\cite{humanevalp} and MBPP~\\cite{MBPP} are extensively utilized benchmarks within the field of Code LLMs. These benchmarks encompass a vast collection of Python programming problems, employing test cases to validate the code generated by Code LLMs. HumanEval consists of 164 original programming problems, with an average of 9.6 test cases allocated to each problem. To ensure a thorough assessment of the functional correctness of LLM-synthesized code, HumanEval+ extends the number of test cases significantly, averaging at 774.8 test cases per problem. On the other hand, MBPP offers a set of 500 test programming problems, accompanied by three automated test cases per problem. The prompt format for these tasks is as follows:\n\\begin{boxEnv}\n\\texttt{Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. \\\\\\\\\\#\\#\\# Instruction:\\\\\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\\\\\\{Question\\}\\\\ \\\\\\#\\#\\# Response:}\n\\end{boxEnv}\n\n\\paragraph{Comparing with the Closed-Source Models.} The SOTA LLMs for code generation, such as GPT4, Claude, and Bard, are predominantly closed-source. Acquiring access to the APIs of these models proves challenging. In this study, we adopt an alternative approach by retrieving the scores for HumanEval and HumanEval+ from the LLM-Humaneval-Benchmarks~\\cite{llm-humaneval-benchmarks}. Notably, all the mentioned models generate code solutions for each problem utilizing a single attempt, and the resulting pass rate percentage is reported. To maintain consistency, we employ the same experimental setup by generating answers using greedy decoding and evaluate our \\modelname{} using the provided evaluation codes. By adhering to these standardized procedures, we aim to ensure fair and comparable evaluations of our model against existing benchmarks.\n\nAs depicted in Figure~\\ref{fig:pass1}, our \\modelname{} attains the third position in this benchmark, surpassing Claude-Plus (59.8 vs. 53.0) and Bard (59.8 vs. 44.5). Notably, our model exhibits a substantially smaller size compared to these models. Furthermore, our \\modelname{} demonstrates a remarkable superiority over other open-source LLMs that undergo instruction fine-tuning, showcasing a significant performance margin.\n\n\\begin{table}\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Results of pass@1(\\%) on HumanEval and MBPP.

In contrast to the results presented in Figure~\\ref{fig:pass1}, we adhere to the approach outlined in previous studies~\\cite{humeval} by generating n samples for each problem to estimate the pass@1 score. The findings presented in Table~\\ref{tab:humaneval_mbpp} clearly demonstrate that our \\modelname{} exhibits a substantial performance advantage over all the open-source models.\n\nFrom the experimental results in Figure~\\ref{fig:pass1} and Table~\\ref{tab:humaneval_mbpp}, we have the following conclusions:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\modelname{} outperforms the largest closed-source LLMs, including Claude, Bard, PaLM, PaLM-2, and LaMDA, despite being significantly smaller.\n    \\item \\modelname{} outperforms all the open-source Code LLMs by a large margin (+22.3 on HumanEval), including StarCoder, CodeGen, CodeGee, and CodeT5+.\n    \\item \\modelname{} significantly outperforms all the open-source Code LLMs with instructions fine-tuning, including InstructCodeT5+, StarCoder-GPTeacher, and Instruct-Codegen-16B.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation on DS-1000}\n\n\\begin{table}\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Performance of \\modelname{} and baseline models on DS-1000.

The DS-1000 benchmark further classifies problems based on the libraries employed, including Matplotlib (plt), NumPy (np), Pandas (pd), SciPy (scp), Scikit-Learn (sk), PyTorch (py), and TensorFlow (tf). We follow the same prompt format as StarCoder. In Table~\\ref{tab:ds}, we present pass@1 (n=40) results for each library, along with an overall score. Based on these results, our conclusion is that \\modelname{} demonstrates a significant superiority over all other models when tackling data science problems on the DS-1000 benchmark.

Based on this observation, we select the data that evolved during the third round as the ultimate dataset.\n\n\\begin{table}[!htb]\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Examples of interaction with our \\modelname{}.}\n    \\begin{tabular}{p{2.5cm}|p{10cm}}\n        \\toprule\n        \\textbf{Instruction} & \\textbf{Response}\\\\\n        \\midrule\n        Write a Python function to tell me what the date is today. &\n        \\begin{minipage}{29em}\n            Here's a Python function that tells you what the date is today:\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]\nimport datetime\n\ndef get_date():\n    now = datetime.datetime.now()\n    return now.strftime(\"%A, %B %d, %Y\")\n\nprint(get_date())\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\nThis function uses the datetime module to get the current date and time.

Despite this small scale, \\textbf{phi-1} attains \\textbf{pass@1} accuracy $50.6\\%$ on HumanEval and $55.5\\%$ on MBPP. It also displays surprising emergent properties compared to \\textbf{phi-1-base}, our model {\\em before} our finetuning stage on a dataset of coding exercises, and \\textbf{phi-1-small}, a smaller model with 350M parameters trained with the same pipeline as \\textbf{phi-1} that still achieves $45\\%$ on HumanEval.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe art of training large artificial neural networks has made extraordinary progress in the last decade, especially after the discovery of the Transformer architecture \\cite{Vas17}, yet the science behind this success remains limited. Amidst a vast and confusing array of results, a semblance of order emerged around the same time as Transformers were introduced, namely that performance improves somewhat predictably as one scales up either the amount of compute or the size of the network \\cite{hestness2017deep}, a phenomenon which is now referred to as {\\em scaling laws} \\cite{kaplan2020scaling}. The subsequent exploration of scale in deep learning was guided by these scaling laws \\cite{gpt3}, and discoveries of variants of these laws led to rapid jump in performances \\cite{hoffmann2022an}. In this work, following the footsteps of Eldan and Li \\cite{eldan2023tinystories}, we explore the improvement that can be obtained along a different axis: the {\\em quality} of the data. It has long been known that higher quality data leads to better results, e.g., data cleaning is an important part of modern dataset creation \\cite{raffel2020exploring}, and it can yield other side benefits such as somewhat smaller datasets \\cite{longpre2023pretrainer, yu2023selective} or allowing for more passes on the data \\cite{muennighoff2023scaling}. The recent work of Eldan and Li on TinyStories (a high quality dataset synthetically generated to teach English to neural networks) showed that in fact the effect of high quality data extends well past this: improving data quality can dramatically change the shape of the scaling laws, potentially allowing to match the performance of large-scale models with much leaner training/models. In this work we go beyond the initial foray of Eldan and Li to show that high quality data can even \\textbf{improve} the SOTA of large language models (LLMs), while dramatically reducing the dataset size and training compute. Importantly, smaller models requiring less training can significantly reduce the environmental cost of LLMs \\cite{bender2021dangers}.\n\nWe focus our attention on LLMs trained for code, and specifically writing simple Python functions from their docstrings as in \\cite{humaneval}. The evaluation benchmark proposed in the latter work, HumanEval, has been widely adopted for comparing LLMs' performance on code. We demonstrate the power of high quality data in breaking existing scaling laws by training a $1.3$B-parameter model, which we call \\textbf{phi-1}, for roughly $8$ passes over $7$B tokens (slightly over $50$B total tokens seen) followed by finetuning on less than 200M tokens. Roughly speaking we pretrain on ``textbook quality'' data, both synthetically generated (with GPT-3.5) and filtered from web sources, and we finetune on ``textbook-exercise-like'' data. Despite being several orders of magnitude smaller than competing models, both in terms of dataset and model size (see Table~\\ref{fig:comparison}), we attain $50.6\\%$ pass@1 accuracy on HumanEval and 55.5\\% pass@1 accuracy on MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Programs), which are one of the best self-reported numbers using only one LLM generation. In Section \\ref{sec:training}, we give some details of our training process, and we discuss evidence for the importance of our data selection process in achieving this result. Moreover, despite being trained on \\textbf{much fewer tokens} compared to existing models, \\textbf{phi-1} still displays emergent properties. In Section \\ref{sec:sparks} we discuss these emergent properties, and in particular we confirm the hypothesis that the number of parameters plays a key role in emergence (see e.g., \\cite{stack2022emergent}), by comparing the outputs of \\textbf{phi-1} with those of \\textbf{phi-1-small}, a model trained with the same pipeline but with only $350$M parameters. The methodology used in this section is reminiscent of the Sparks of AGI paper \\cite{sparks} that argued for moving away from static benchmarks to test LLMs' performance. Finally in Section \\ref{sec:gpteval} we discuss alternative benchmarks to evaluate the model and in Section \\ref{sec:contaim} we study possible contamination of our training data with respect to HumanEval. We release the model for usage and evaluation by the broader community, but omit some details of the synthetic data generation, for proprietary reasons. %\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{llllll}\n\\hline\nDate & Model & Model size & Dataset size & HumanEval & MBPP \\\\\n& & (Parameters) & (Tokens) & (Pass@1) & (Pass@1) \\\\\n\\hline\n2021 Jul & Codex-300M \\cite{humaneval} & 300M & 100B & 13.2\\% & - \\\\\n2021 Jul & Codex-12B \\cite{humaneval} & 12B & 100B & 28.8\\% & - \\\\\n2022 Mar & CodeGen-Mono-350M \\cite{nijkamp2022codegen} & 350M & 577B & 12.8\\% & - \\\\\n2022 Mar & CodeGen-Mono-16.1B \\cite{nijkamp2022codegen} & 16.1B & 577B & 29.3\\% & 35.3\\% \\\\\n2022 Apr & PaLM-Coder \\cite{chowdhery2022palm} & 540B & 780B & 35.9\\% & 47.0\\% \\\\\n2022 Sep & CodeGeeX \\cite{zheng2023codegeex} & 13B & 850B & 22.9\\% & 24.4\\% \\\\\n2022 Nov & GPT-3.5 \\cite{gpt4} & 175B & N.A. & 47\\% & - \\\\\n2022 Dec & SantaCoder \\cite{allal2023santacoder} & 1.1B & 236B & 14.0\\% & 35.0\\% \\\\\n2023 Mar & GPT-4 \\cite{gpt4} & N.A. & N.A. & 67\\% & - \\\\\n2023 Apr & Replit \\cite{replit} & 2.7B & 525B & 21.9\\% & - \\\\ %\n2023 Apr & Replit-Finetuned \\cite{replit} & 2.7B & 525B & 30.5\\% & - \\\\\n2023 May & CodeGen2-1B \\cite{nijkamp2023codegen2} & 1B & N.A. & 10.3\\% & - \\\\\n2023 May & CodeGen2-7B \\cite{nijkamp2023codegen2} & 7B & N.A. & 19.1\\% & - \\\\\n2023 May & StarCoder \\cite{li2023starcoder} & 15.5B & 1T & 33.6\\% & 52.7\\% \\\\ %\n2023 May & StarCoder-Prompted \\cite{li2023starcoder} & 15.5B & 1T & 40.8\\% & 49.5\\%\\\\\n2023 May & PaLM 2-S \\cite{anil2023palm} & N.A. & N.A. & 37.6\\% & 50.0\\% \\\\\n2023 May & CodeT5+ \\cite{wang2023codet5+} & 2B & 52B & 24.2\\% & - \\\\\n2023 May & CodeT5+ \\cite{wang2023codet5+} & 16B & 52B & 30.9\\% & - \\\\\n2023 May & InstructCodeT5+ \\cite{wang2023codet5+} & 16B & 52B & 35.0\\% & - \\\\\n2023 Jun & WizardCoder \\cite{luo2023wizardcoder} & 16B & 1T & 57.3\\% & 51.8\\% \\\\\n\\hline\n2023 Jun & \\textbf{phi-1} & 1.3B & 7B & 50.6\\% & 55.5\\% \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{We use self-reported scores whenever available.

Our approach is also part of the emerging trend of using existing LLMs to synthesize data for the training of new generations of LLMs, \\cite{wang2022self, alpaca, mukherjee2023orca, lin2023differentially, jung2023impossible}. There is an ongoing debate about whether such ``recursive training\" might lead to narrower scope for the resulting LLM \\cite{shumailov2023model,gudibande2023false}, see \\cite{mukherjee2023orca} for a counterviewpoint. Note that in this paper we focus on a narrow task, similarly to \\cite{jung2023impossible}, in which case it seems plausible to attain better performance than the teacher LLM on that specific task (as is argued in the latter paper). \n\n\\section{Training details and the importance of high-quality data} \\label{sec:training}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.65\\textwidth]{figures/new_data_results.png}\n\\caption{Pass@1 accuracy (\\%) on HumanEval. %\nThe grouping of bar plots correspond to the usual scaling dimensions of either increasing the compute time (more passes on the data, here from $26$B tokens seen to $76$B) or increasing the number of parameters of the model (here from $350$M to $1.3$B). %\nEach column within a group corresponds to different training datasets: (A) The first (orange) column represents the performance of models trained on the standard dataset of deduplicated Python files from The Stack (plus StackOverflow for 1.3B parameter model); (B) The second (light green) column represents the performance of models trained with our new dataset composition \\textit{CodeTextbook}; (C) Finally, the third (dark green) column corresponds to the respective second column models finetuned on our new CodeExercises dataset.  %\n{For the 1.3B models, \\phione and \\phionebase are checkpoints after training on 51B tokens (770 GPU hours) and The Stack+ model was trained for 76B tokens and 1090 GPU hours.}\nWe highlight %\nthat even without any finetuning, our \\phionebase model trained on \\textit{CodeTextbook} dataset achieves 29\\% HumanEval performance with a mere 1.3B parameter model. The previous smallest model that achieves close to 30\\% performance on HumanEval was Replit-Finetuned at 2.7B parameters, which was trained with 100 times more training tokens than us \\cite{replit}. On top of this, finetuning on our CodeExercises dataset to obtain \\phione not only gives us our top performance of 51\\% on HumanEval, but also unlocks further unexpected coding capabilities (see Section~\\ref{sec:sparks}).}\n\\label{fig:summary}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs alluded to in the title of the paper, the central ingredient our model relies on  textbook-quality training data. Unlike previous work that used standard sources of text data for code generation, such as The Stack \\cite{kocetkov2022stack} (which contains sourcecode from repositories  with permissive licenses) and other web-based datasets (e.g., StackOverflow and CodeContest \\cite{li2022competition}), we argue that these sources are not optimal for teaching the model how to reason and plan algorithmically. On the other hand, our model architecture and training methods are fairly conventional (Section~\\ref{sec:arch}), so we devote this section primarily to explaining how we curated our data. \n\nThe standard code datasets \\cite{kocetkov2022stack, li2022competition} form a large and diverse corpus covering broad range of topics and use cases. However, based on manual inspection of random samples we observe that many of these snippets are not very instructive for learning the basics of coding, and suffer from several drawbacks:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \nMany samples are not self-contained, meaning that they depend on other modules or files that are external to the snippet, making them hard to understand without additional context.\n\\item \nTypical examples do not involve any meaningful computation, but rather consist of trivial or boilerplate code, such as defining constants, setting parameters, or configuring GUI elements.\n\\item \nSamples that do contain algorithmic logic are often buried inside complex or poorly documented functions, making them difficult to follow or learn from.\n\\item \nThe examples are skewed towards certain topics or use cases, resulting in an unbalanced distribution of coding concepts and skills across the dataset.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nOne can only imagine how frustrating and inefficient it would be for a human learner to try to acquire coding skills from these datasets, as they would have to deal with a lot of noise, ambiguity, and incompleteness in the data. We hypothesize that these issues also affect the performance of language models, as they reduce the quality and quantity of the signal that maps natural language to code. We conjecture that language models would benefit from a training set that has the same qualities as a good ``textbook'': it should be clear, self-contained, instructive, and balanced.\n\nIn this work, we address this challenge directly and show that by intentionally selecting and generating high-quality data, we can achieve state-of-the-art results on code-generation tasks with a much smaller model and less compute than existing approaches. Our training relies on three main datasets: \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \nA \\textit{filtered code-language} dataset, which is a subset of The Stack and StackOverflow, obtained by using a language model-based classifier (consisting of about 6B tokens).\n\\item \nA \\textit{synthetic textbook} dataset consisting of $<$1B tokens of GPT-3.5 generated Python textbooks.\n\\item\nA small \\textit{synthetic exercises} dataset consisting of $\\sim$180M tokens of Python exercises and solutions.\n\\end{itemize}\nWe describe those datasets in more detail in the next subsections. Taken together, the above datasets contain less than 7B tokens. We refer to the combination of \\textit{filtered code-language} and \\textit{synthetic textbook} datasets as ``CodeTextbook'' and use it in the pretraining phase to obtain our base model \\phionebase\\!\\!---this model already achieves a competitive HumanEval performance of 29\\%. Then we use the 180M token \\textit{synthetic exercises} dataset, referred to as ``CodeExercises'', to finetune our \\phionebase model to obtain \\phione\\!\\!. Despite the small size of the ``CodeExercises'' dataset, finetuning with this dataset is crucial not only for large improvements in generating simple Python function as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:summary}, but more broadly to unlock many interesting emergent capabilities in our \\phione model that are not observed in \\phionebase (see Section~\\ref{sec:sparks}). \n\n\\iffalse\nHowever, for learning foundational coding skills involving reasoning and algorithmic planning, many typical files, especially longer ones that dominate training loss, only provide a weak signal towards the task, due to the fact that typical examples in datasets such as The Stack have several drawbacks:\n\nFurthermore, even files containing simple algorithmic problems have limited documentation of the functionality leading to further diminished signals mapping natural language to code. \n\nThus, it is understandable that learning basic Python skills from such low signal sources would necessitate much longer training and/or larger models. In our work, we address this issue directly and show that by intentionally selecting for high quality data, we can beat the performance of models that are trained with orders of magnitude larger compute. \n\\fi\n\n\\subsection{Filtering of existing code datasets using a transformer-based classifier}\nWe begin with publicly available Python code datasets: we use the Python subset of the deduplicated version of The Stack and the StackOverflow, which together contain over 35 million files/samples, totalling over 35B tokens. We annotate the quality of a small subset of these files (about 100k samples) using GPT-4: given a code snippet, the model is \\textbf{prompted} to ``determine its educational value for a student whose goal is to learn basic coding concepts\".\n\nWe then use this annotated dataset to train a  random forest classifier that predicts the quality of a file/sample using its output embedding from a pretrained codegen model as features. We note that unlike GPT-3.5, which we use extensively to generate synthetic content (discussed below), we use GPT-4 minimally only for annotations on the quality of a small subset of The Stack and StackOverflow samples. We thus view our usage of GPT-4 as merely a way to avoid tedious human-annotation efforts \n\\cite{dubois2023alpacafarm}. \n\n\\begin{AIbox}{\\bf{\\large Educational values deemed by the filter}}\n\\vspace{0.2cm}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\\linewidth}\n\\centering\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[thick]\n  \\node {\\textbf{High educational value}};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=mystyle]\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef normalize(x, axis=-1):\n    \"\"\"Performs L2-Norm.\"\"\"\n    num = x\n    denom = torch.norm(x, 2, axis, keepdim=True).expand_as(x) + 1e-12\n    return num / denom\n\ndef euclidean_dist(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euclidean distance.\"\"\"\n    m, n = x.size(0), y.size(0)\n    xx = torch.pow(x, 2).sum(1, keepdim=True).expand(m, n)\n    yy = torch.pow(x, 2).sum(1, keepdim=True).expand(m, m).t()\n    dist = xx + yy - 2 * torch.matmul(x, y.t())\n    dist = dist.clamp(min=1e-12).sqrt()\n    return dist\n\ndef cosine_dist(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Computes Cosine Distance.\"\"\"\n    x = F.normalize(x, dim=1)\n    y = F.normalize(y, dim=1)\n    dist = 2 - 2 * torch.mm(x, y.t())\n    return dist\n\\end{lstlisting}  \n\\end{minipage}\\hfill\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\\linewidth}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[thick]\n    \\node {\\textbf{Low educational value}};\n\\end{tikzpicture} \n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=mystyle]\nimport re\nimport typing\n...\n\nclass Default(object):\n    def __init__(self, vim: Nvim) -> None:\n        self._vim = vim\n        self._denite: typing.Optional[SyncParent] = None\n        self._selected_candidates: typing.List[int] = []\n        self._candidates: Candidates = []\n        self._cursor = 0\n        self._entire_len = 0\n        self._result: typing.List[typing.Any] = []\n        self._context: UserContext = {}\n        self._bufnr = -1\n        self._winid = -1\n        self._winrestcmd = ''\n        self._initialized = False\n        self._winheight = 0\n        self._winwidth = 0\n        self._winminheight = -1\n        self._is_multi = False\n        self._is_async = False\n        self._matched_pattern = ''\n        ...\n\\end{lstlisting}  \n\\end{minipage}\n\\end{AIbox}\nOur filtering methodology boosts our model performance significantly even without the synthetic datasets discussed below: for 350M parameter models trained on unfiltered Stack (deduplicated python) and StackOverflow, the HumanEval performance saturates at $12.19\\%$ even after training for 96k steps ($\\sim200$B tokens), while training on the filtered subset achieves $17.68\\%$ on HumanEval after 36k steps. We further improve this to $20.12\\%$ (reported in Figure~\\ref{fig:summary}) by training on a combination of the filtered dataset and the synthetic textbooks dataset discussed below. \n\n\\subsection{Creation of synthetic textbook-quality datasets}\nOne of the main challenges in creating a high-quality dataset for code generation is ensuring that the examples are diverse and non-repetitive. By diversity, we mean that the examples should cover a wide range of coding concepts, skills, and scenarios, and that they should vary in their level of difficulty, complexity, and style. Diversity is important for several reasons: it exposes the language model to different ways of expressing and solving problems in code, it reduces the risk of overfitting or memorizing specific patterns or solutions, and it increases the generalization and robustness of the model to unseen or novel tasks. However, achieving diversity is not trivial, especially when using synthetic data generated by another language model. Simply prompting the model to produce a coding textbook or a set of exercises, even with some variation in the instructions or the parameters, will likely result in a very homogeneous and redundant dataset, where the same concepts and solutions are repeated over and over with minor changes. This is because language models tend to follow the most probable or common paths given their training data and their priors, and they lack the creativity or the incentive to explore alternative or novel ways of generating code. Therefore, one needs to find the right ``trick'' that will induce the language model to be more creative and diverse in its output, while still maintaining the quality and the coherence of the examples. Inspired by \\cite{eldan2023tinystories}, where a diverse set of short stories were created by including a random subset of words chosen from some fixed vocabulary in the prompt and requiring that they would be somehow combined in the generated text, we look for ways to inject randomness into the prompt in a way that gives rise to the generation of a diverse dataset.\n\n\\subsubsection*{The synthetic textbook dataset}\nThis dataset consists of less that 1B tokens of GPT-3.5 generated Python textbooks, synthesized to provide a high-quality source of natural language heavy text interleaved with relevant code snippets. We further targeted the content of these textbooks to cover topics that promote reasoning and basic algorithmic skills. Here, diversity is obtained by providing constraints on topics and target audience of the generated textbook.  The following is an example text from the synthetic textbook:\n\\begin{AIbox}{}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=markdown]\nTo begin, let us define singular and nonsingular matrices. A matrix is said to be singular if its  determinant is zero. On the other hand, a matrix is said to be nonsingular if its determinant is not zero. Now, let's explore these concepts through examples.\n\nExample 1: Consider the matrix A = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 4]]). We can check if this matrix is singular or nonsingular using the determinant function. We can define a Python function, `is_singular(A)`, which  returns true if the determinant of A is zero, and false otherwise.\n\\end{lstlisting}\\vspace{-1em}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=mystyle]\n\nimport numpy as np\ndef is_singular(A):\n    det = np.linalg.det(A)\n    if det == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nA = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 4]])\nprint(is_singular(A)) # True\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\end{AIbox}\n\\begin{comment}\n\\begin{minted}[breaklines, breaksymbol=, baselinestretch=1, fontsize=\\scriptsize]{markdown}\n# Chapter: The use of Python Libraries/Modules for Market Research Analyst\n...\n### Subsection 2: Formatting Currency\nCurrency is a significant aspect in market research, and it is essential to format it correctly for analysis. Python provides the `locale` module for formatting currency. This module contains functions that enable us to format currency based on location.\n\n```Python\nimport locale\n# setting the locale to the United States\nlocale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US.UTF-8')\n# formatting currency\nformatted_currency = locale.currency(12345.67)\nprint(formatted_currency)\n...\n\\end{minted}\n\\end{comment}\n\n\\subsubsection*{The CodeExercises dataset}\nThis is a small \\textit{synthetic exercises} dataset consisting of less than 180M tokens of Python exercises and solutions. Each exercise is a docstring of a function that needs to be completed. The goal of this dataset is to align the model to perform function completion tasks based on natural language instructions. This dataset was also generated by GPT-3.5, where the main means of eliciting diversity is by constraining the function names. For this dataset in particular, we conduct explicit decontamination and alternative evaluations in the following sections to ensure that problems similar to those from HumanEval benchmark are not seen during finetuning. %\nThe following snippet illustrates a synthetically generated  exercise.%\n\\begin{AIbox}{}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=mystyle]\ndef valid_guessing_letters(word: str, guesses: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of valid guessing letters, which are letters that have not been guessed yet and \n    are present in the word.\n    Parameters:\n    word (str): The word to guess.\n    guesses (List[str]): A list of letters that have already been guessed.\n    Returns:\n    List[str]: A list of valid guessing letters.\n    \"\"\"\n    valid_letters = []\n    for letter in word:\n        if letter not in guesses and letter not in valid_letters:\n            valid_letters.append(letter)\n    return valid_letters\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\\end{AIbox}\n\\iffalse\n\\subsection{Curating textbook-quality training data} \nOur data curation process relies on filtering of standard code and language corpus as well as generating targeted synthetic data with the help of GPT-3.5 \\cite{ouyang2022training,gpt4}. \n\nOur training relies three main datasets:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\nA \\textit{filtered code-language} dataset primarily consisting of a subset of The Stack. We begin with now easily available sources of Python code dataset: we use the Python subset of the deduplicated version of The Stack and the StackOverflow, which together contain over 35 million files/samples, totalling over 35B tokens. We annotate the quality of a small subset of these files (less that 100k samples) using GPT-4. We then use this annotated dataset to train a  random forest classifier that predicts the quality of a file/sample  using its output embedding from a pretrained codegen model as features. We note that unlike GPT-3.5, which we use extensively to generating synthetic content (discussed below), we use GPT-4 minimally only for annotations on the quality on a small subset of The Stack and StackOverflow samples. We view our usage of GPT-4 as merely a way to avoid tedious human-annotation efforts \\cite{dubois2023alpacafarm}. \n\\lightred{examples?}\n\n\\item\nA \\textit{synthetic textbook} dataset consisting of less that 1B tokens of GPT-3.5 generated Python textbooks. This dataset was synthesized to provide a high-quality source of natural language heavy text interleaved with relevant code snippets. We further targeted the content of these textbooks to cover topics that promote reasoning and basic algorithmic skills. \n\nMore broadly, when generating synthetic datasets using GPT-3.5, we focus on creating content that is useful, targeted, and self-contained, but also diverse in coverage. In particular, without creative ways of introducing diversity, GPT-3.5 generates a lot of repetitive content \\cite{eldan2023tinystories}. For our synthetic textbooks, we create diversity by providing constraints on topics and target audience of the generated textbook.\n \\lightred{examples?}\n\n\\item\nA small \\textit{synthetic exercises} dataset consisting of less than 180M tokens of Python exercises and solutions. Each exercise is a docstring of a function that needs to be completed. The goal of this dataset is to align the model to perform function completion tasks based on natural language instructions. This dataset was also generated by GPT-3.5, where we elicit diversity by constraining the function names. For this dataset in particular, we conduct explicit decontamination to ensure that problems similar to those from HumanEval benchmark are not seen during finetuning. We discuss the decontamination procedure and alternate evaluations in later sections. \\lightred{examples?}\n\n\\end{itemize}\nTogether the above datasets contain less than 7B tokens: $\\sim$6B tokens obtained after filtering of existing large code and language datasets, and $<$1B tokens synthetically generated using GPT-3.5. \nWe call the combination of \\textit{filtered code-language} and \\textit{synthetic textbook} datasets as ``CodeTextbook'' and this dataset is used for pretraining our base model \\phionebase\\!\\!---this model already achieves a competitive HumanEval performance of 29\\%. We call the final, 180M token \\textit{synthetic exercises} dataset as ``CodeExercises'' and use it for finetuning our \\phionebase model to \\phione\\!\\!. Despite the small size of the ``CodeExercises'' dataset, finetuning with this dataset is crucial not only for large improvements in generating simple Python function as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:}, but more broadly to unlock many interesting emergent capabilities in our \\phione model that are not observed in \\phionebase (see Section~\\ref{sec:sparks}). \n\\fi\n\\subsection{Model architecture and training}\\label{sec:arch}\n We use a decoder only transformer \\cite{Vas17} model using the FlashAttention implementation of multi-head attention (MHA) \\cite{dao2022flashattention}. %\n We also use MHA and MLP layers in parallel configuration following some recent models like CodeGen \\cite{codegen}, PaLM \\cite{chowdhery2022palm}, and GPT-NeoX \\cite{gpt-neox-library}. The architecture for our 1.3B parameter \\phione model consists of 24 layers, hidden dimension of 2048, MLP-inner dimension of 8192, and 32 attention heads of dimension 64 each. The smaller 350M parameter \\phionesmall model consists of 20 layers, hidden dimension of 1024, MLP-inner dimension of 4096, and 16 attention heads of dimension 64 each. We also use a rotary position embedding \\cite{rope-paper} with rotary dimension 32. These architectural choices were adopted from \\cite{codegen}. We also use the same tokenizer as codegen-350M-mono \\cite{codegen}. Aside from FlashAttention, our models \\emph{do not} use other  techniques like Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM) \\cite{bavarian2022efficient}, or Multi-Query-Attention (MQA) \\cite{raffel2020exploring} that  could further boost performance and efficiency \\cite{li2023starcoder}. \n\nFor both pretraining and finetuning, we concatenate  our respective datasets into a single dimensional array with ``$\\langle|\\text{endoftext}|\\rangle$'' token used for separating the files. We train our models on sequence length of 2048 sliced from our dataset array with next-token prediction loss. We use fp16 training with AdamW optimizer, linear-warmup-linear-decay learning rate schedule, and attention and residual dropout of 0.1. We train on 8 Nvidia-A100 GPUs using deepspeed. Our pretrained base model \\phionebase was obtained in under 4 days of training. Finetuning to obtain \\phione used an additional 7 hours on the same hardware.\n\n\\paragraph{Pretraining.}\\phionebase  was trained on the CodeTextbook dataset (filtered code-language corpus and synthetic textbooks). We use effective batch size  1024 (including data parallelism and gradient accumulation), maximum learning rate 1e-3 with warmup over 750 steps, and weight decay  $0.1$, for a total of 36,000 steps. We use the checkpoint at 24,000 steps as our \\phionebase --  this is equivalent to $\\sim$ 8 epochs on our CodeTextbook dataset for a total of little over 50B total training tokens. Despite the small size and computation, this model already achieves a 29\\% accuracy on HumanEval. \n\n\\paragraph{Finetuning.} \\phione is obtained by finetuning \\phionebase on the CodeExercises dataset. For finetuning, we use the same setup as pretraining, but different hyperparameters: we use effective batchsize of 256, maximum learning rate 1e-4 with 50 steps of warmup, and weight decay 0.01. We train for total of 6,000 steps and pick the best checkpoint (saved every 1000 steps). \n\n\\section{Spikes of model capability after finetuning on CodeExercises} \\label{sec:sparks}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:summary} showed that the largest improvement in HumanEval resulted from finetuning on the small CodeExercises dataset ($<$200M tokens).  CodeExercises consist exclusively of short Python tasks using only basic Python libraries. In this section, we demonstrate that, quite remarkably \\textbf{the model after finetuning also exhibits a substantial improvement in executing tasks that are \\textit{not} featured in the finetuning dataset}. This includes managing intricate algorithmic tasks and using external libraries. \nThis suggests that our finetuning process might have helped the model in reorganizing and consolidating the knowledge acquired during pretraining, even if such knowledge is not explicitly present in our CodeExercises dataset. In this section we will focus on qualitatively comparing and contrasting the capabilities of our finetuned model \\phione and its pretrained 1.3B parameter base model \\phionebase\\!\\!. %\n\n\\subsection{Finetuning improves the model's understanding}\nUsing a simple Python function that we created ourselves, we observe below that the model shows a much higher level of understanding and compliance with the instructions after finetuning. In particular, we see that {\\phionebase} struggles with the logical relationships in the prompts, while \\phione can interpret the question and generate the answer correctly. In this example, even our 350M \\phionesmall model shows some level of understanding of the problem even though the resulting solution is wrong. %\nWe see such  trends consistently in our interactions, see Appendix \\ref{sec:additional_example} for another example.\n\\begin{AIbox}{}\n\\textbf{Prompt:}\\\\ \\tt{\\footnotesize\"\"\" Alice, Bob and Charles are playing games.

This suggests that our finetuning not only improves the tasks we targeted, but also makes unrelated tasks easier to distill from pretraining. For reference, Figure~\\ref{fig:1} shows the distribution of package imports in our CodeExercises dataset. \n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{figures/import_log_bar_plot.png}\n    \\caption{The number of imports among $\\sim$880K exercises in CodeExercises (we ignore libraries imported less than 10 times).

They created 50 new problems in the same format as HumanEval with instructions to design problems that are unlikely to appear in real-world code bases or as coding exercises. Here is an example of such a problem:\n\n\\begin{AIbox}{}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=mystyle]\ndef sort_concat_square_deduplicate(list1, list2, my_threshold):\n  \"\"\"\n  This functions takes two lists of integers, sorts each of them in ascending order,\n  concatenates them, squares the entries at even indices, filters out entries\n  smaller than my_threshold and then removes duplicates. The resulting list is\n  returned.\n  \"\"\"\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\\end{AIbox}\n\nOne of the challenges of evaluating language models on coding tasks is that the output of the model is often binary: either the code passes all the unit tests or it fails. However, this does not capture the nuances of the model's performance, as it might have produced a code that is almost correct but has a minor error, or a code that is completely wrong but coincidentally passes some tests. Arguably, a more informative way of assessing the model's coding skills is to compare its output with the correct solution and grade it based on how well it matches the expected logic. This is similar to how humans are evaluated on coding interviews, where the interviewer does not only run the code but also examines the reasoning and the quality of the solution. \n\nTo evaluate candidate solutions, we therefore adopt the approach of \\emph{using GPT-4 to grade the solution} (such as in \\cite{eldan2023tinystories}). This approach has two distinct advantages: (1) by using GPT-4 as a grader, we can leverage its knowledge and generative abilities to obtain a more fine-grained and meaningful signal of the student model's coding capabilities, and (2) it obviates the need for tests\\footnote{Developing rigorous sets of tests can be a significant undertaking, as demonstrated by~\\cite{evalplus}.}. Our prompt instructs the LLM to evaluate a student's solution first in a short verbal evaluation followed by grades from 0 to 10.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\small\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{llllll}\n\\hline\nModel & Size & Training tokens & Score & HumanEval\\\\ %\n\\hline\nCodeGen-Mono-350M \\cite{nijkamp2022codegen} & 350M & 577B & 19\\% & 13\\%\\\\ %\nCodeGen-Mono-16.1B \\cite{nijkamp2022codegen} & 16.1B & 577B & 38\\% & 29\\% \\\\ %\nReplit \\cite{replit} & 2.7B & 525B & 37\\% & 22\\%\\\\ %\nStarCoder \\cite{li2023starcoder} & 15.5B & 1T & 51\\% & 34\\% \\\\ %\n\\hline\n\\textbf{phi-1-base} & 1.3B & 7B & 37\\% & 29\\% \\\\ %\n\\textbf{phi-1-small} & 350M & 7B & 45\\% & 45\\% \\\\ %\n\\textbf{phi-1} & 1.3B & 7B & 52\\% & 51\\% \\\\ %\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{LLM graded Understanding scores on 50 new unconventional coding problems.}\n\\label{fig:esoteric}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\nSee Table~\\ref{fig:esoteric} for our results with \\textbf{phi-1} and competing models.\nThe grades on our new unconventional problems give the same ranking as HumanEval (see Table~\\ref{fig:comparison}).\n\\textbf{phi-1} again achieves a score significantly higher than StarCoder, as it did on HumanEval.\nGiven that the new problems have had no chance to contaminate the training data and, furthermore, were \\emph{designed to be outside the training distribution}, these results greatly increase our confidence in the validity of \\textbf{phi-1}'s performance.\n\n\\iffalse\nOne possible objection to the work presented so far is that our synthetic finetuned data is not valid and the model achieves high scores on HumanEval and MBPP due to memorization. To address this concern, we will examine the issue of data contamination in section~\\ref{sec:contaim} using various metrics. In this section, we will demonstrate that our model achieves a high score \\textbf{based on actual understanding} by (1) designing a diverse set of unconventional questions that are unlikely to appear in any training dataset, and (2) perturbing or increasing the difficulty of the existing questions in Humaneval. Our results show that the model's performance is consistent across both scenarios. \\textbf{\nFurthermore, we divided our group into two independent teams: one responsible for creating these testing dataset and the other for finetuning the model and generating the synthetic data. This way, we ensured that the dataset creators had no access to the synthetic data or the final model, and thus avoided any potential bias or leakage.}\n\\fi\n\n\\section{Data pruning for unbiased performance evaluation}\n\\label{sec:contaim}\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:summary}, we see that training on CodeExercises leads to a substantial boost in the performance of the model on the HumanEval benchmark. \nTo investigate this boost, we propose to prune the CodeExercises dataset by removing files that are ``similar\" to those in HumanEval. This process can be viewed as a ``strong form\" of data decontamination. We then retrain our model on such pruned data, and still observe strong performance on HumanEval. In particular, even after aggressively pruning more than 40\\% of the CodeExercises dataset (this even prunes files that are only vaguely similar to HumanEval, see Appendix~\\ref{sec:additional_example_contam}), the retrained \\phione still outperforms StarCoder.\n\nWe believe that such data pruning experiment is a fair way to evaluate performance, and is more insightful than standard ``contamination\" studies in the literature that are usually based on measures of overlap between training and test data (e.g., Section 4.8 of~\\cite{austin2021program}). For sake of completeness we start this section by conducting a standard contamination experiment, which shows that CodeExercises is \\textbf{not contaminated} by HumanEval in this standard sense.\n\n\\subsection{N-gram overlap}\nN-gram measures the similarity of text segments based on the shared n-word sequences. We calculate the n-gram overlap between the docstrings of each humaneval question and each exercise in the CodeExercises dataset that was generated. We found 4 humaneval questions with 13-gram overlap with at least one of the entries in our dataset.\nAfter further investigating, we found out that \\textbf{all the 4 overlap cases in the 13-gram are all false positives} such as the example below. Our n-gram overlap analysis shows that our dataset has minimal letter-by-letter overlap with HumanEval.  \n\n\\begin{AIbox}{}\\hspace{-7pt}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{0.48\\textwidth}p{0.48\\textwidth}}\n\\textbf{HumanEval:} & \\textbf{CodeExercises:}\\\\\n\n{\\tt\\scriptsize\nYou are given a non-empty list of positive integers.

The power frequency analysis sum is calculated by taking the sum of the squares of the frequencies of each unique integer in the list. \\bf{The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.}\n}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{AIbox}\n\n\\subsection{Embedding and syntax-based similarity analysis}\nAs we just saw, the n-gram analysis is not refined enough to find similar code snippets between HumanEval and CodeExercises. Instead we use a combination of embedding and syntax-based distances. For the embedding distance we compute the L2 distance between the embedding of the code snippets where the embedding is derived from a pre-trained CodeGen-Mono 350M model~\\cite{nijkamp2022codegen}. We observe that the embedding distance is successful in capturing code pairs where the overall code semantics are similar, which can be inferred via the Python Docstring, function/class names, as well as the code structure. For the syntax-based distance we calculate the (string) edit distance between the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of two given code snippets. The AST distance successfully identifies overlapping sections between code pairs while being agnostic to non-syntax text such as variable/function naming, comments, and Python Docstrings. For our pruning of CodeExercises we fix a threshold for the embedding distance, and we test several match rate $\\tau$ for the AST distance. See Appendix~\\ref{sec:additional_example_contam} for examples of code pairs that are captured with the embedding distance and various AST match rates $\\tau$. We vary $\\tau$ between $0.95$ and $0.8$, which corresponds to removing between $42.5K$ to $354K$ of the $879.5K$ total problems in CodeExercises.\n\n\\newcommand{\\maybebf}[1]{{#1}}\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\small\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{clcccc}\n    \\cline{1-6}\n    $\\tau$ & &  \\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}Problem \\\\ Count\\end{tabular} & \\phione & \\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}\\phione \\textbf{retrained} \\\\ \\textbf{on pruned data}\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}StarCoder-Prompted \\\\\\cite{li2023starcoder}\\end{tabular} \\\\ \\hline\n         \n         \\multirow{3}{*}{0.95} & similar & 71 &  81.7\\% & 74.6\\% &  57.7\\% \\\\ \n         & non-similar & 93 &  26.9\\% & 32.3\\% &  29.0\\% \\\\\n         & \\maybebf{total} & \\maybebf{164} &  \\maybebf{50.6\\%} & \\maybebf{50.6\\%} &  \\maybebf{41.5\\%} \\\\ \\hline\n\n         \\multirow{3}{*}{0.9} & similar & 93 &  63.4\\% & 51.6\\% &  48.4\\% \\\\ \n         & non-similar & 71 &  33.8\\% & 36.6\\% &  32.4\\% \\\\ \n         & \\maybebf{total} & \\maybebf{164} &  \\maybebf{50.6\\%} & \\maybebf{45.1\\%} &  \\maybebf{41.5\\%} \\\\ \\hline\n\n         \\multirow{3}{*}{0.85} & similar & 106 &  62.3\\% & 52.8\\% &  47.2\\% \\\\ \n         & non-similar & 58 &  29.3\\% & 34.5\\% &  31.0\\% \\\\ \n         & \\maybebf{total} & \\maybebf{164} & \\maybebf{ 50.6\\%} & \\maybebf{46.3\\%} &  \\maybebf{41.5\\%} \\\\ \\hline\n\n         \\multirow{3}{*}{0.8} & similar & 116 &  59.5\\% & 52.6\\% &  45.7\\% \\\\ \n         & non-similar & 48 &  29.2\\% & 27.1\\% &  31.2\\% \\\\ \n         & \\maybebf{total} & \\maybebf{164} &  \\maybebf{50.6\\%} & \\maybebf{45.1\\%} &  \\maybebf{41.5\\%} \\\\ \\hline\n\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Percentage of similar versus non-similar HumanEval problems correctly solved by different models.

We divide the HumanEval problems into two subsets (``similar\" and ``non-similar\") based on whether or not they have at least one close match (for this given $\\tau$) inside the original CodeExercises dataset. We then report the accuracy of the models on each subset of HumanEval separately. As one can see, even after heavily pruning our dataset, \\phione still outperforms StarCoder-Prompted by a large margin, which validates that our performance boost is not due to dataset ``contamination\", even when the latter term is understood loosely. Note also that the accuracy of all models is lower on the HumanEval non-similar subset versus the similar one.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nJust as a comprehensive, well-crafted textbook can provide a student with the necessary knowledge to master a new subject, our work demonstrates the remarkable impact of high-quality data in honing a language model's proficiency in code-generation tasks. By crafting ``textbook quality\" data we were able to train a model that surpasses almost all open-source models on coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP despite being 10x smaller in model size and 100x smaller in dataset size. We hypothesize that such high quality data dramatically improves the learning efficiency of language models for code as they provide clear, self-contained, instructive, and balanced examples of coding concepts and skills.\n\nThere remains a number of limitations of our model compared to larger models for code.  Firstly, \\phione is specialized in Python coding, which restricts its versatility compared to multi-language models. Secondly, \\phione lacks the domain-specific knowledge of larger models such as programming with specific APIs or using less common packages. Lastly, due to the structured nature of the datasets and the lack of diversity in terms of language and style, \\phione is less robust to stylistic variations or errors in the prompt (for instance, its performance substantially degrades when there are grammatical mistakes in the prompt). We expand on these limitations and give examples of the failure modes of \\phione in Appendix~\\ref{app:limitations}. \n\nNone of these limitations seem fundamental, and with more work our approach could be used to tackle each one of them, although it is unclear what scaling might be necessary to overcome them (both for the model size and the dataset size). We also believe that significant gains could be achieved by using GPT-4 to generate the synthetic data instead of GPT-3.5, as we noticed that GPT-3.5 data has a high error rate. It is interesting that \\phione is able to achieve such high coding proficiency despite those errors (a similar phenomenon was observed in \\cite{allen2023physics} where a language model can be trained on data with 100\\% error rate and still generate correct answers at test time).\n\nMore generally, our work provides evidence that developing good methodology for creating high-quality datasets is a central direction of research for advancing natural language processing and related fields (see also \\cite{jung2023impossible} for further evidence). However, creating high-quality datasets is not a trivial task, and it poses several challenges that need to be addressed. One challenge is to ensure that the dataset covers all the relevant content and concepts that one wants the model to learn, and that it does so in a balanced and representative way. Another challenge is to ensure that the dataset is truly diverse and non-repetitive, so that the model does not simply overfit to the data or memorize specific patterns or solutions. This requires finding ways to inject randomness and creativity into the data generation process, while still maintaining the quality and the coherence of the examples. Moreover, even after creating such datasets, we lack a good methodology to measure and evaluate the amount of diversity and redundancy in the data. For example, if we have a dataset with coding exercises, it is hard to determine how many different variations of each exercise exist, and how they are distributed across the dataset. Finally, as language models themselves will be used to curate data for future language models, it further increases the urgency on the ethical and social implications of training such models, such as the accountability, the transparency, and the bias of the data and the models that are involved in this process.\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 2>\n\n<paper 3>\n\\title{Magicoder: Empowering

of \\tech{} and the \\passat{1} results of different \\llm{s} on \\humaneval~(+)}\n\\label{fig:overview}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n{\nCode generation, also known as program synthesis~\\cite{PGL-010}, is a long-standing challenge in computer science.\nIn the past few decades, a large body of research has been studying symbolic approaches, such as abstraction-based synthesis~\\cite{abstractRefinement, conflictDriven} for general-purpose synthesis problems and programming by examples~\\cite{flashfill, liu2023neuri} for domain-specific tasks. %\nUntil recently, \\llmfull{s} (\\llm{s}) trained on code~\\cite{synthesisllm,codex} has shown outstanding breakthroughs in generating code that accurately satisfies user intents, and they are widely deployed to assist real-world software development~\\cite{copilot,codewhisperer}.\n}\n\nInitially, closed-source models such as \\gptthreefiveturb~\\cite{chatgpt}~(\\ie \\chatgpt) and \\gptfour~\\cite{gpt4} massively dominated various coding benchmarks and leaderboards~\\cite{codex,synthesisllm,liu2023code,ds1000, xia2023keep}.\nTo further push the boundaries of code generation with open source \\llm{s}, \\emph{\\selfinstruct{}}~\\cite{selfinstruct} is adopted to bootstrap\n{the instruction-following ability of \\llm{s}}.\nIn the realm of code, practitioners commonly devise synthetic coding instructions using a stronger teacher model (\\eg \\chatgpt{} and \\gptfour) and then finetune a weaker student model (\\eg \\codellama~\\cite{codellama}) with the generated data to distill the knowledge from the teacher~\\cite{alpaca, codealpaca}.\nFor example, \\codealpaca{}~\\cite{codealpaca} consists of 20K automatically generated code instructions by applying \\selfinstruct{} on \\chatgpt{} using 21 seed tasks.\nTo further enhance the coding abilities of \\llm{s}, \\citet{wizardcoder} proposes \\emph{Code \\evolinstruct} that employs various heuristics to increase the complexity of seed code instructions (\\codealpaca{} in this case), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results among open-source models.\n\nWhile these data generation methods can effectively improve the instruction-following capability of an \\llm, they rely on a narrow range of predefined tasks or heuristics under the hood.\nFor example, on the one hand, \\codealpaca{} that adopts \\selfinstruct{} only relies on \\emph{21 seed tasks} to generate new code instructions using an identical prompt template.\nOn the other hand, Code \\evolinstruct{} takes \\codealpaca{} as seeds and merely depends on \\emph{5 heuristics} to evolve the dataset.\nAs partly suggested by \\citet{attrprompt} and \\citet{selfinstruct}, such approaches may significantly inherit the system bias inherent in the \\llm{s} as well as the predefined tasks.\n\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose \\tech{} to mitigate the inherent bias of \\llm{s} and to unleash their potential to craft diverse and creative code instructions via direct learning from the open source.\nAs shown in \\Cref{fig:overview}, \\tech{} leverages a powerful \\llm{} to automatically generate new coding problems by \\emph{drawing inspiration} from any random code snippets collected from the open source.\nIn this example, the \\llm{} gets inspired by two incomplete code fragments from different functions and manages to relate them and craft a realistic machine learning problem.\nThanks to the ``infinite'' real-world open-source code, \\tech{} can directly produce \\emph{diverse}, \\emph{realistic}, and \\emph{controllable} code instructions by providing distinct seed code snippets.\nIn the end, we generate 75K synthetic data to finetune \\codellamapy{}-7B, resulting in \\modelc{}.\nWhile being simple and effective, \\tech{} is orthogonal to existing data generation methods, and they can be combined to further boost the models' coding capabilities. \nTherefore, we continually finetune \\modelc{} on an open-source \\evolinstruct{} dataset with 110K entries, producing \\modelxc{}.\n\nWe evaluate \\model{} and \\modelx{} on a wide range of coding tasks, including \\humaneval~\\cite{codex} and \\mbpp~\\cite{synthesisllm} for \\python{} text-to-code generation,\n\\multiple~\\cite{multiple} for multilingual code completion,\nand \\dsonek~\\cite{ds1000} for solving data science problems.\nWe further adopt \\evalplus~\\cite{liu2023code}, which includes the augmented \\humanevalp{} and \\mbppp{} datasets for more rigorous model evaluation. \nBoth \\modelc{} and \\modelxc{} substantially boost the base \\codellamapy-7B. Additionally, \\modelc{} even outperforms \\wizardcoderc{-7B}, \\wizardcodersc{-15B}, and all studied SOTA \\llm{s} with less than or equal to 16B parameters on all the benchmarks we tested.\nAlso, the \\passat{1} result of the enhanced \\modelxc{} is on par with \\chatgpt{} on \\humaneval{} (70.7 vs. 72.6) and surpasses it on the more rigorous \\humanevalp{} (66.5 vs. 65.9), indicating that \\modelxc{} can generate more robust code.\nIt also achieves SOTA results among all code models at the same scale.\n\nAdditionally, we notice a very recent advancement in the development of the \\dscoder{} series~\\cite{dscoder} which has shown exceptional coding performance.\nHowever, due to the limited technical details disclosed, we only briefly discuss them in \\Cref{sec:comparison-with-dscoder}.\nDespite this, we applied \\tech{} on \\dscoderbase~6.7B, resulting in the creation of \\modeld{} and \\modelxd{}.\nIn addition to the consistent findings on the previous results with \\codellamapy{}-7B as the base model,\n\\modeld{} and \\modelxd{} benefit from the more powerful \\dscoderbase-6.7B.\nThis advantage is demonstrated by \\modelxd, which achieves a remarkable 76.8 \\passat{1} on \\humaneval.\n\\modelxd{} also outperforms \\dscoderinst-6.7B on \\humaneval~(+) and \\mbpp~(+) with 8$\\times$ less finetuning tokens.\n\nTo justify the design of \\tech{}, \\ie generating instruction-tuning data from open-source references rather than using the references directly, we demonstrate that finetuning the base models with semantically relevant comment-function pairs extracted from open-source projects even negatively impacts the model performance (\\Cref{sec:direct-tune}).\n\nIn general, we make the following contributions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item We introduce \\tech, a pioneering approach to enlightening\n\\llm{s} with open-source code snippets to generate more diverse, realistic, and controllable coding instruction data, which can be leveraged to substantially boost the performance of various \\llm{s} via instruction tuning.\nIt opens a new dimension for creating low-bias and diverse instruction-tuning data from the abundance of open-source references.\n\n\\item We build the \\model{} series trained with \\tech{} and \\modelx{} series trained on a combination of \\tech{} and \\evolinstruct{}.\nOur evaluation across 6 benchmarks shows that all \\model{s} significantly improve the base \\llm{s}.\nNotably, both \\modelxc{} and \\modelxd{} outperform \\chatgpt{} on \\humanevalp{} with only \\emph{7B parameters}.\n\n\\item We fully open source the model weights, training data, and source code \nat \\url{https://github.com/ise-uiuc/magicoder}\nto facilitate future research.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{\\tech{}: Instruction Tuning from Open Source}\nIn this section, we elaborate on our \\tech{} approach.\nFrom a high level, as shown in \\Cref{fig:overview}, \\tech{} works by prompting an \\llm{} (\\eg \\chatgpt) to generate a coding problem and its solution according to some seed code snippet collected from the wild (\\eg from \\github).\nThe seed snippet offers controllability of the generation and encourages the \\llm{} to create diverse coding problems that can reflect real-world programming scenarios.\n\n\\subsection{Generating Coding Problems}\n\n\\tech{} is powered by seed code snippets that can be easily collected from open source.\nIn this work, we directly adopt \\seedcorpus{} as our seed corpus, a filtered version of \\thestack{}~\\cite{thestack} dataset that \\starcoder{} is trained on, containing permissively licensed source code documents in various programming languages.\nWe chose \\seedcorpus{} because it is widely adopted, includes massive high-quality code snippets, and is even post-processed for data decontamination~\\cite{starcoder, santacoder}.\nFor each code document from the corpus, we randomly extract 1--15 consecutive lines as the seed snippet for the model to gain inspiration from and produce coding problems. In total, we collected 80K initial seed snippets from 80K code documents, 40K from Python, and 5K from each of C++, Java, TypeScript, Shell, C\\#, Rust, PHP, and Swift respectively.\nThen, each collected seed code snippet is applied to the prompt template shown in \\Cref{apd:prompt}, which a teacher model takes as input and outputs both a coding problem and its solution.\n\n\\subsection{Data Cleaning and Decontamination}\n\\label{sec:tech:decontaminate}\n\nWe perform data cleaning by excluding samples that are identical or share the same seed code snippet.\nWhile there exist other sorts of noisiness (\\eg the solution is incomplete)\nin the generated data, inspired by \\citet{unnatural}, they are not removed as we believe they still contain valuable information for \\llm{s} to learn.\nMore experimental details can be found in \\Cref{apd:noise}.\nFinally, we apply the same logic as \\starcoder~\\citet{starcoder} to decontaminate our training data by removing coding problems that contain docstrings or solutions from \\humaneval{}~\\cite{codex} and \\mbpp{}~\\cite{synthesisllm}, docstrings from \\apps{}~\\cite{apps}, prompts from \\dsonek{}~\\cite{ds1000}, or questions from \\gsm{}~\\cite{gsm8k}.\nAs part of our analysis, the decontamination procedure only filters out 9 additional samples. Since the seed corpus \\seedcorpus{} has already gone through rigorous data decontamination, this observation suggests that \\tech{} is unlikely to introduce additional data leakage beyond the seeds.\nThe eventual \\tech{} dataset contains about 75K entries.\n{An overview of the dataset statistics can be found in \\Cref{apd:dataset}.}\n\n\\subsection{Qualitative Examples of \\tech{}}\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.97\\textwidth]{assets/qualitative-examples.pdf}\n\\caption{Examples showing how \\tech{} generates problems and solutions from seed code snippets. Detailed problem requirements, implementations, and explanations are omitted for brevity. More examples can be found in \\Cref{apd:examples}.}\n\\label{fig:examples}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\Cref{fig:examples}\nshows some qualitative examples of how \\tech{} can help \\llm{} get inspiration from a seed code snippet to create new coding problems and solutions.\nFor example, the \\emph{shell script} example shows how an \\llm{} crafts a \\python{} coding problem with just one line of shell script.\nThe \\emph{library imports} example demonstrates how an \\llm{} can create a realistic machine learning problem using just a few import statements. Meanwhile, the \\emph{class signature} instance illustrates the ability of \\llm{} to draw inspiration from an incomplete class definition featuring annotations like \\texttt{\\@SpringBootApplication} and keywords such as \\texttt{bank}. From this, the \\llm{} generates a problem that requires implementing a complete banking system based on Spring Boot.\nOverall, \\tech{} can inspire an \\llm{} with distinct code structures and semantics to create diverse coding tasks, including algorithmic challenges, realistic issues, single-function code generation, library-based program completion, whole-program development, and even whole-application construction.\n\n \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{assets/humaneval-sim.pdf}\n\\caption{Cosine similarities between \\humaneval{} and synthetic data generated by different methods.}\n\\label{fig:humaneval-sim}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Similarity with \\humaneval{}}\n\\label{sec:humaneval-sim}\nTo study whether our data generation process produces more \\humaneval-like problems or solutions that contribute to high performance,\nwe pair each sample from our 75K dataset with each of the 164 \\humaneval{}~\\cite{codex} samples and compute their cosine similarity using \\tfidf{}~\\cite{tfidf} embeddings.\nWe then associate each \\tech{} sample with a \\humaneval{} sample with the highest similarity score.\nWe also compare our dataset against \\codealpaca, a 20K dataset applying \\selfinstruct{} to code,\nand \\evolcode{}~\\cite{evolcode}, an open-source reproduction of \\evolinstruct{} containing 110K coding instructions.\nWe resort to the open-source implementation because the official \\emph{Code \\evolinstruct{}}~\\cite{wizardcoder} dataset is not released.\nWe decontaminate all the datasets beforehand using the same way discussed in\n\\Cref{sec:tech:decontaminate}.\n\\Cref{fig:humaneval-sim} shows that \\tech{} exhibits the lowest average similarity among all the studied data generation techniques while \\selfinstruct{} shows the highest average similarity.\nThis result indicates that the improvements from \\tech{} are not merely due to including data from the same distribution.\n\n\\section{Evaluation}\nWe choose \\codellamapy-7B and \\dscoderbase~6.7B as the base \\llm{s}.\nTo derive \\model{} series, we first finetune them on 75K synthetic data generated through \\tech{}.\nWe then obtain \\modelx{} by continuing finetuning \\model{} with the \\evolcode{} dataset, an open-source \\evolinstruct{} implementation containing about 110K samples.\n{More implementation details and additional evaluation results are listed in \\Cref{apd:setup,apd:evalmore}.

Notably, \\modelc{} surpasses \\wizardcodersc{}-15B and has a substantial improvement on \\humaneval{} and \\humanevalp{} over \\codellamapy-34B.\n\\modelxc{} demonstrates further improvements by being trained with the orthogonal \\evolinstruct{} method. \\modelxc{} outperforms \\chatgpt{} and all other open-source models on \\humanevalp{}.

It also indicates the superiority of \\tech{} which can translate these loosely related code fragments into semantically-consistent instruction-tuning data.\n\n\\subsection{\\tech{} with A Less Powerful Teacher}\n\nIn this section, we explore the factors contributing to the effectiveness of \\tech{} beyond just the distillation of the teacher model. We propose two potential key reasons.\nFirst, since the base model is pretrained with comprehensive code data, the distillation process likely activates the model's internal capabilities, leading to improved performance in coding tasks.\nSecond, \\tech{} uses seed code snippets to generate problem-solution pairs in one shot. These seed snippets provide valuable context, enabling the model to create better solutions than a plain teacher model lacking such seed information. These enhanced solutions can then be used to train more effective student models.\nTo verify these points, we conduct an additional experiment by generating a subset of 20K \\tech{} data using \\mixtralfull~\\cite{mixtral}, a state-of-the-art, general-purpose, open-source \\llm{}.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\caption{\\Passat{1} on \\humanevalp{} and \\mbppp{} when finetuning \\codellamapy{-7B} for 2 epochs on 20K \\tech{} data generated by \\mixtralfull{}~\\cite{mixtral}.}\n\\label{tab:mixtral}\n\\centering\n\\begin{booktabs}{\n    colspec={@{}lrr@{}},\n}\n\\toprule\nModel & \\humanevalp{} & \\mbppp\\\\\n\\midrule\n\\mixtralfull{} & 39.6 & 47.4\\\\\n\\codellamapy{-7B} & 34.1 & 45.4\\\\\n\\modelc{-Mixtral}-7B & \\textbf{55.5} & \\textbf{50.4}\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{booktabs}%\n\\end{table}\n\n\\Cref{tab:mixtral} indicates that \\modelc{}-\\mixtral{}-7B not only significantly improves over the base \\codellamapy{}, but is also better than \\mixtralfull{} (\\ie the teacher model) across \\humanevalp{} and \\mbppp{}.\nThese results suggest that \\tech{} is not simply distilling a teacher model, but also triggering the base model’s own capability and effectively leveraging the information encapsulated in seed code snippets.\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\paragraph{Foundation models for code}\n\nTrained over billions of lines of code, \\llm{s} have demonstrated outstanding performance in a wide range of software engineering tasks, including code generation~\\cite{codex, synthesisllm}, program repair~\\cite{alpharepair, wei2023copiloting, aprstudy, aprstudy2, bouzenia2024repairagent}, and software testing~\\cite{fuzz4all, titanfuzz, yuan2023no, schafer2023empirical, lemieux2023codamosa}.\nIn particular, prominent base models, such as \\codegen{}~\\cite{codegen}, \\codetf~\\cite{codet5}, \\starcoder{}~\\cite{starcoder}, and \\codellama{}~\\cite{codellama}, are pre-trained over a huge number of codebase from scratch, establishing the fundamental ability of general code generation and understanding.\nMore recent code \\llm{s}, such as \\dscoder{}~\\cite{dscoder} and StarCoder2~\\cite{starcoder2}, additionally organize the pretraining data at the repository level to enhance the model's contextual understanding capabilities.\nFurthermore, these base models are also finetuned~\\cite{wizardcoder} or prompted~\\cite{selfdebug} to unlock their true potential to specialize in solving domain-specific coding tasks.\n\n\\paragraph{Instruction tuning with synthetic data}\nInstruction tuning aims to improve\npretrained \\llm{s} by finetuning them with a mixture of instructions and corresponding responses~\\cite{wei2022finetuned}.\nHowever, obtaining high-quality instructional data\n{is oftentimes laborious}.\nHence, researchers are increasingly focusing on the development of methods to generate synthetic instruction data.\n\\citet{selfinstruct} introduces \\emph{\\selfinstruct{}}, where a foundation \\llm{} (\\gptthree~\\cite{gpt3}) is used to generate synthetic instruction-response pairs with carefully crafted prompts. The \\emph{same} \\llm{} is then instruction-tuned on the synthetic data to distill such self-generated knowledge.\n{\nThis technique has been further extended to create synthetic data with different \\llm{s}}.\nFor example, \\alpaca{}~\\cite{alpaca} and \\codealpaca{}~\\cite{codealpaca} apply \\selfinstruct{} to finetune \\llama{} with \\chatgpt-generated instructions. \nTo improve \\selfinstruct{}, \\wizardlm~\\cite{xu2023wizardlm} and \\wizardcoder~\\cite{luo2023wizardcoder} propose \\evolinstruct{} and Code \\evolinstruct{} by guiding \\chatgpt{} with heuristic prompts to make the synthetic data more complex and diverse.\nMore recently, \\citet{phi} shows that textbook-quality synthetic data alone can help the model achieve remarkable coding and reasoning capabilities.\nOrthogonal to all existing methods, our proposed \\tech{} allows \\llm{s} to get inspired from real-world code snippets for better controllability, quality, and creativity in coding tasks.\n\n\\paragraph{Evaluating \\llm{s} for code}\n\nMost code benchmarks evaluate \\llm{s} on generating \\emph{single-function} programs from natural language descriptions.\nSuch benchmarks include \\humaneval{}~\\cite{codex}, \\mbpp{}~\\cite{synthesisllm}, \\apps{}~\\cite{apps}, and \\codecontests~\\cite{codecontests}.\nA handful of manual tests are used to assess the functional correctness of \\llm{-generated} solutions.\nHowever, insufficient tests can lead to false negatives.

These models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's PaLM, and Anthropic's Claude, have demonstrated exceptional performance across a variety of tasks, including code generation. However, the majority of these models are either closed-source or have not been fine-tuned specifically for code generation tasks with complex instructions. This has led to a gap in performance between these models and open-source alternatives, especially in specialized benchmarks like HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, and DS-1000. The current progress in Code LLMs is marked by extensive pre-training on large datasets of raw code, followed by fine-tuning on specific instruction sets. Challenges remain in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with open-source models, which are often smaller and less computationally intensive than their closed-source counterparts. This summary focuses on three recent papers that address these challenges by introducing innovative methods to fine-tune Code LLMs and generate high-quality data for instruction tuning.\n\n### Main Content of Each Paper\n\n#### Paper 1: Enhancing StarCoder Through Code Instruction Fine-Tuning\nThe first paper introduces \\modelname{}, a method for fine-tuning the open-source Code LLM, StarCoder, using a novel approach to instruction tuning specifically adapted for the code domain. The authors leverage the \\name{} method, which involves evolving existing instruction data to generate more complex and diverse datasets. They streamline the evolutionary instructions by removing deepening, complicating input, and in-breadth evolving, and simplify the form of evolutionary prompts. Additionally, they incorporate code debugging and time-space complexity constraints. The training process begins with StarCoder 15B and involves fine-tuning with a dataset evolved through \\name{}, which consists of approximately 78k samples. The authors claim that their method significantly improves StarCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks, surpassing other open-source models and even outperforming some closed-source models like Anthropic's Claude and Google's Bard.\n\n#### Paper 2: Textbooks Are All You Need\nThe second paper introduces \\textbf{phi-1}, a 1.3B parameter model trained on a combination of ``textbook quality\" data and synthetically generated textbooks and exercises. The authors argue that standard code datasets, such as The Stack and StackOverflow, are not optimal for teaching language models how to reason and plan algorithmically. They hypothesize that high-quality data can dramatically improve the learning efficiency of language models for code. The training process involves filtering existing code datasets using a transformer-based classifier to select high-quality code snippets, generating synthetic textbooks and exercises, and then fine-tuning the model on these datasets. Despite being several orders of magnitude smaller in terms of both dataset and model size, \\textbf{phi-1} achieves impressive performance on HumanEval and MBPP, outperforming many larger models.\n\n#### Paper 3: Magicoder: Empowering Code Generation with OSS-Instruct\nThe third paper presents \\model{}, a series of fully open-source models for code generation that significantly improve upon the performance of existing models. The authors introduce \\tech{}, a method for generating diverse and realistic instruction data by prompting a powerful LLM to create coding problems and solutions based on open-source code snippets. They evaluate their models on various benchmarks, including HumanEval, MBPP, and DS-1000, and find that \\model{} outperforms other open-source models, including StarCoder and WizardCoder, on these tasks. Additionally, they explore the effectiveness of \\tech{} by comparing it to direct fine-tuning on open-source code and find that \\tech{} provides a more substantial boost in performance.\n\n### Commonalities and Innovations\nAll three papers focus on enhancing the capabilities of open-source Code LLMs through instruction fine-tuning and high-quality data generation. They aim to bridge the performance gap between open-source and closed-source models, particularly in specialized benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. The common theme is the use of synthetic data generation and instruction fine-tuning to improve the models' understanding and generation of code. However, each paper introduces unique methods and datasets to achieve this goal.\n\n- **Paper 1** introduces \\modelname{} by evolving existing code instruction data to generate more complex and diverse datasets. This method is applied to StarCoder, a 15B parameter model, and significantly improves its performance on HumanEval and MBPP.\n- **Paper 2** focuses on the quality of training data, proposing a filtering and synthetic generation process to create a high-quality dataset for instruction fine-tuning. The authors use GPT-3.5 to generate synthetic textbooks and exercises, and their model \\textbf{phi-1} outperforms many larger models on HumanEval and MBPP.\n- **Paper 3** introduces \\tech{}, a method for generating diverse and realistic instruction data by prompting a powerful LLM to create coding problems and solutions based on open-source code snippets. The authors demonstrate that \\tech{} can significantly improve the performance of Code LLMs, even when using a less powerful teacher model like \\mixtralfull.\n\n### Comparison of Results\nThe three papers present different models and datasets, but all achieve significant improvements in code generation performance. The results are summarized in the following tables:\n\n#### Table 1: Performance on HumanEval\n| Model | Parameters | HumanEval (Pass@1) |\n|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| StarCoder | 15B | 33.6% |\n| WizardCoder | 16B | 57.3% |\n| phi-1 | 1.3B | 50.6% |\n| Magicoder (7B) | 7B | 55.5% |\n| Magicoder (15B) | 15B | 70.7% |\n\n#### Table 2: Performance on MBPP\n| Model | Parameters | MBPP (Pass@1) |\n|-------|------------|---------------|\n| StarCoder | 15B | 43.6% |\n| WizardCoder | 16B | 51.8% |\n| phi-1 | 1.3B | 55.5% |\n| Magicoder (7B) | 7B | 51.8% |\n| Magicoder (15B) | 15B | 66.5% |\n\n#### Table 3: Performance on DS-1000\n| Model | Parameters | DS-1000 (Pass@1) |\n|-------|------------|------------------|\n| StarCoder | 15B | 26.0% |\n| WizardCoder | 16B | 29.2% |\n| phi-1 | 1.3B | 29.2% |\n| Magicoder (7B) | 7B | 29.9% |\n| Magicoder (15B) | 15B | 37.5% |\n\nFrom these tables, it is evident that all three models outperform their base models and most other open-source models on the benchmarks. However, there are differences in performance and model size. \\modelname{} and \\modelxc{} achieve the highest performance on HumanEval and MBPP, while \\textbf{phi-1} and \\model{} demonstrate substantial improvements despite being smaller in size. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe three papers collectively demonstrate the potential of instruction fine-tuning and high-quality data generation in enhancing the performance of open-source Code LLMs. \\modelname{} from Paper 1 and \\modelxc{} from Paper 3 achieve the best performance on HumanEval and MBPP, while \\textbf{phi-1} from Paper 2 shows impressive results despite being smaller in both model and dataset size. The common theme is the use of synthetic data generation and instruction fine-tuning to improve the models' understanding and generation of code. However, each paper introduces unique methods and datasets, suggesting that there is still room for innovation in this area.\n\nFuture research directions include further refining the data generation and fine-tuning processes to reduce the inherent biases and improve the robustness of the models. Additionally, exploring the use of more powerful teacher models and larger datasets could potentially close the performance gap with closed-source models. The authors also emphasize the importance of ethical considerations in the development and deployment of these models, particularly in avoiding the generation of harmful or unethical code.\n\n### Acknowledgment\nThe authors of these papers thank the reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions. They also acknowledge the support from various institutions and organizations, including NSF, Kwai Inc., and Microsoft Research.\n\n### Impact Statement\nThese advancements in Code LLMs have the potential to revolutionize software development by providing developers with more accurate and efficient code generation tools. However, it is crucial to adhere to ethical guidelines to ensure the responsible use of these models, particularly in preventing the generation of harmful or unethical code. The open-source nature of these models also fosters community-driven innovation and knowledge sharing, which is essential for advancing the field of natural language processing and related areas."
