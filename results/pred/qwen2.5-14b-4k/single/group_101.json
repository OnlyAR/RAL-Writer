The task has received much attention in the natural\n    language processing community due to its potential for various\n    information access applications. Examples include tools which digest\n    textual content (e.g., news, social media,  reviews), answer\n    questions, or provide recommendations.\n    \n    The task is often divided into two paradigms, \\textit{abstractive}\n    summarization and \\textit{extractive}    summarization.\n        In abstractive\n    summarization, target summaries contains words or phrases that were not in the original text and usually require various text rewriting operations to generate, while extractive approaches\n    form summaries by\n    copying and concatenating the most important spans (usually\n    sentences) in a document.  In this paper, we focus on extractive summarization.\n    \n    Although many neural models have been proposed for extractive summarization recently~\\citep{cheng2016neural,nallapati2017summarunner,narayan2018ranking, dong2018banditsum, zhang2018neural, zhou2018neural}, the improvement on automatic metrics like ROUGE has reached a bottleneck due to the complexity of the task.\n       In this paper, we argue that,  BERT~\\citep{devlin2018bert}, with its pre-training on a huge dataset and the powerful architecture for learning complex features, can further boost the performance of extractive summarization .\n    \n    In this paper, we focus on designing different variants of using BERT on the extractive summarization task and showing their results on CNN/Dailymail and NYT datasets.\n    We found that a flat architecture with inter-sentence Transformer layers performs the best, achieving the state-of-the-art results on this task.\n    \n    \n    \\begin{figure*}[t]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width=16cm]{bert5}\n        \\label{trans}\n        \\caption{The overview  architecture of the \\textsc{Bertsum} model.}\n    \\end{figure*}\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \\section{Methodology}\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Let $d$~denote a document containing several sentences\n    $[sent_1, sent_2, \\cdots, sent_m]$, where $sent_i$ is the $i$-th\n    sentence in the document.  Extractive summarization can be defined as\n    the task of assigning a label $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ to each $sent_i$,\n    indicating whether the sentence should be included in the summary. It\n    is assumed that summary sentences represent the most important content    of the document.\n    \n    \\subsection{Extractive Summarization with BERT}\n    \n    To use BERT for extractive summarization, we require it to output the representation for each sentence. However, since BERT is trained as a masked-language model, the output vectors are grounded to tokens instead of sentences. Meanwhile, although BERT has segmentation embeddings for indicating different sentences, it only has two labels (sentence A or sentence B), instead of multiple sentences as in extractive summarization.\n    Therefore, we modify the input sequence and embeddings of  BERT to make it possible for extracting summaries.\n    \n    \\paragraph{Encoding Multiple Sentences} As illustrated in Figure 1, we insert a [CLS] token before each sentence and a [SEP] token after each sentence.\n    In vanilla BERT, The      [CLS] is used as a symbol to aggregate features from one sentence or a pair of sentences. We modify the model by using multiple [CLS] symbols to get features for  sentences ascending the symbol.\n    \n    \\paragraph{Interval Segment Embeddings}\n    We use interval segment embeddings to distinguish multiple sentences within a document. For $sent_i$ we will assign a segment embedding $E_A$ or $E_B$ conditioned on $i$ is odd or even. For example, for  $[sent_1, sent_2, sent_3, sent_4, sent_5]$ we will assign $[E_A, E_B, E_A,E_B, E_A]$.\n    \n    The vector $T_i$ which is the vector of the $i$-th [CLS] symbol from the top BERT layer will be used as the representation for $sent_i$.\n    \n    \n    \\subsection{Fine-tuning with Summarization Layers}\n    After obtaining the sentence vectors from BERT, we build several summarization-specific layers stacked on top of the BERT outputs, to capture document-level features for extracting summaries. \n    For each sentence $sent_i$, we will calculate the final predicted score $\\hat{Y}_i$.\n        The loss of the whole model is the Binary Classification Entropy of $\\hat{Y}_i$ against gold label $Y_i$.\n    These summarization layers  are jointly fine-tuned with BERT.\n\n    \n    \\paragraph{Simple Classifier}\n    Like in the original BERT paper, the Simple Classifier only adds a linear layer on the BERT outputs and use a sigmoid function to get the predicted score:\n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{Y}_i = \\sigma(W_oT_i+b_o)\n    \\end{equation}\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Sigmoid function.\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \\paragraph{Inter-sentence Transformer}\n    Instead of a simple sigmoid classifier, Inter-sentence Transformer applies more Transformer layers only on sentence representations, extracting document-level features focusing on  summarization tasks from the BERT outputs:\n    \\begin{gather}\n    \\tilde{h}^l=\\mathrm{LN}(h^{l-1}+\\mathrm{MHAtt}(h^{l-1}))\\\\\n    h^l=\\mathrm{LN}(\\tilde{h}^l+\\mathrm{FFN}(\\tilde{h}^l))\n    \\end{gather}\n    where $h^0=\\mathrm{PosEmb}(T)$ and $T$ are the sentence vectors output by BERT, $\\mathrm{PosEmb}$ is the function of adding positional embeddings (indicating the position of each sentence) to $T$;\n    $\\mathrm{LN}$ is the layer normalization operation~\\cite{ba2016layer}; $\\mathrm{MHAtt}$ is the multi-head attention operation~\\cite{vaswani2017attention};\n    the superscript $l$ indicates the depth of the stacked layer.\n    \n    The final output layer is still a sigmoid classifier:\n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{Y}_i = \\sigma(W_oh_i^L+b_o)\n    \\end{equation}\n    where $h^L$ is the vector for $sent_i$ from the top layer (the $L$-th layer ) of the Transformer. In experiments, we implemented Transformers with $L=1, 2, 3$  and found Transformer with $2$ layers performs the best.\n    \n    \\paragraph{Recurrent Neural Network}\n    Although the Transformer model achieved great results on several tasks, there are evidence that Recurrent Neural Networks  still have their advantages, especially when combining with techniques in Transformer~\\cite{chen2018best}. Therefore, we apply an LSTM layer over the BERT outputs to learn summarization-specific features. \n    \n    To stabilize the training,  pergate layer normalization~\\cite{ba2016layer} is applied within each LSTM cell. At time step $i$, the input to the LSTM layer is the BERT output $T_i$, and the output is calculated as:\n    \\begin{gather}\n    \\left (\n    \\begin{tabular}{c}\n    $F_i$ \\\\\n    $I_i$\\\\\n    $O_i$\\\\\n    $G_i$\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\right )=\\mathrm{LN}_h(W_hh_{i-1})+\\mathrm{LN}_x(W_xT_i)\\\\\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\nonumber C_i =&~\\sigma(F_i)\\odot C_{i-1}\\\\\n    &+\\sigma(I_i)\\odot \\mathrm{tanh}(G_{i-1})\\\\\n    h_i = &\\sigma(O_t)\\odot \\mathrm{tanh}(\\mathrm{LN}_c(C_t))\\end{align}\n    \\end{gather}\n    where  $F_i, I_i, O_i$ are forget gates, input gates, output gates; $G_i$ is the hidden vector and $C_i$ is the memory vector; $h_i$ is the  output vector; $\\mathrm{LN}_h, \\mathrm{LN}_x, \\mathrm{LN}_c$ are there difference layer normalization operations; Bias terms are not shown.\n    \n    The final output layer is also a sigmoid classifier:\n    \\begin{equation}\n   \\hat{Y}_i = \\sigma(W_oh_i+b_o)\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n                \\begin{table*}[htbp]\n    \\center\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|lll}\n        Model              & ROUGE-1    & ROUGE-2    & ROUGE-L    \\\\ \\hline\n        \\textsc{Pgn}$^*$  &39.53&17.28&37.98\\\\\n\n        \\textsc{Dca}$^*$  &41.69&19.47&37.92\\\\\\hline\n        \\textsc{Lead}               & 40.42  & 17.62  & 36.67  \\\\\n                \\textsc{Oracle}               & 52.59  & 31.24 & 48.87  \\\\\n        \\textsc{Refresh}$^*$              & 41.0  & 18.8 & 37.7  \\\\\n        \\textsc{Neusum}$^*$              & 41.59  & 19.01  & 37.98  \\\\\\hline\n\n        Transformer& 40.90 & 18.02  & 37.17  \\\\\n        \\textsc{Bertsum}+Classifier  & 43.23  & 20.22 & 39.60\\\\\n        \\textsc{Bertsum}+Transformer  & \\textbf{43.25}& \\textbf{20.24}& \\textbf{39.63}\\\\\n        \\textsc{Bertsum}+LSTM  & 43.22  & 20.17 & 39.59\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Test set results on  the CNN/DailyMail  dataset using  ROUGE $F_1$.

Learning rate schedule is following~\\cite{vaswani2017attention} with warming-up on first 10,000 steps:\n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\nonumber lr = 2e^{-3}\\cdot min(step^{-0.5}, step \\cdot warmup^{-1.5})\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    \n    All models are trained for 50,000 steps on 3 GPUs (GTX 1080 Ti) with gradient accumulation per two steps, which makes the batch size approximately equal to $36$.\n    Model checkpoints are saved and evaluated on the validation set every 1,000 steps. We select the top-3 checkpoints based on their evaluation losses on the validations set, and report the averaged results on the test set.\n    \n    When predicting summaries for a new document, we first use the  models to obtain the score for each sentence.\n    We then rank these sentences by the scores from higher to lower, and select the top-3 sentences as the summary.\n    \n    \\paragraph{Trigram Blocking} \n    During the predicting process, Trigram Blocking is used to reduce redundancy.\n    Given selected summary $S$ and a candidate sentence $c$, we will skip $c$ is there exists a trigram overlapping between $c$ and $S$. This is similar to the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)~\\cite{carbonell1998use}  but much simpler.\n    \n    \n    \\subsection{Summarization Datasets}\n    We evaluated  on two benchmark datasets, namely the\n    CNN/DailyMail news highlights dataset \\cite{hermann2015teaching} and\n    the New York Times Annotated Corpus (NYT; \\citealt{nytcorpus}).\n    The CNN/DailyMail dataset contains news articles and associated\n    highlights, i.e.,~a few bullet points giving a brief overview of the\n    article.  We used the standard splits of~\\citet{hermann2015teaching}\n    for training, validation, and testing (90,266/1,220/1,093 CNN\n    documents and 196,961/12,148/10,397 DailyMail documents). We did not\n    anonymize entities.\n    We first split sentences by CoreNLP and pre-process the dataset following methods in \\citet{see-acl17}.\n\n    \n    \n    The NYT dataset contains 110,540 articles with abstractive\n    summaries. Following~\\citet{durrett2016learning}, we split these into\n    100,834 training and 9,706 test examples, based on date of publication\n    (test is all articles published on January 1, 2007 or later).  \n    We took 4,000 examples from the training set as the validation set.\n    We also\n    followed their filtering procedure, documents  with summaries that\n    are shorter than 50 words were removed from the raw dataset.  The\n    filtered test set (NYT50) includes~3,452 test examples.\n        We first split sentences by CoreNLP and pre-process the dataset following methods in \\citet{durrett2016learning}.\n    \n    \n    Both datasets contain abstractive gold summaries, which are not\n    readily suited to training extractive summarization models. A greedy\n    algorithm was used to\n    generate an oracle summary for each document. The algorithm\n    greedily select sentences which can maximize the ROUGE scores as the oracle sentences.\n We assigned label~1 to sentences selected in the oracle\n    summary and 0~otherwise.\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \\section{Experimental Results}\n    The experimental results on CNN/Dailymail datasets are shown in Table 1.\n            For comparison, we implement a non-pretrained Transformer baseline which uses the same architecture as BERT, but with smaller parameters. It is randomly initialized and only trained on the summarization task. The Transformer baseline has 6 layers, the hidden size is $512$ and the feed-forward filter size is $2048$. The model is trained with same settings following~\\citet{vaswani2017attention}.   \n    We also compare our model with several previously proposed systems.        \n\n        \n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textsc{Lead} is an extractive baseline which uses the first-3 sentences of the document as a summary.\n        \n        \\item  \\textsc{Refresh}~\\citep{narayan2018ranking} is an extractive\n        summarization system trained by globally optimizing the ROUGE\n        metric with reinforcement learning.  \n        \n        \\item \\textsc{Neusum}~\\citep{zhou2018neural} is the state-of-the-art extractive system that jontly score and select sentences.\n        \\item  \n        \\textsc{Pgn}~\\citep{see-acl17}, is the Pointer Generator Network, an abstractive summarization system based\n        on an encoder-decoder architecture.  \n        \n        \\item \\textsc{Dca}~\\citep{celikyilmaz2018deep} is the Deep Communicating Agents, a\n        state-of-the-art abstractive summarization system with \n        multiple agents  to represent the document as well as\n        hierarchical attention mechanism over the agents for decoding.\n    \\end{itemize}   \n\n    \n      As illustrated in the table, all   BERT-based models outperformed previous state-of-the-art models by a large margin. \\textsc{Bertsum} with Transformer achieved the best performance on all three metrics. The \\textsc{Bertsum} with LSTM model does not have an obvious influence on the summarization performance compared to the  Classifier model. \n    \n    Ablation studies  are conducted to show the contribution of different components of \\textsc{Bertsum}. The results are shown in in Table 2. Interval segments  increase the performance of base model. Trigram blocking is able to greatly improve the summarization results. This is consistent to previous conclusions that a sequential extractive decoder is helpful to generate more informative summaries. However, here we  use the trigram blocking as a simple but robust alternative.\n\n        \\begin{table}[!htbp]\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|lll}\n        Model              & R-1    & R-2    & R-L    \\\\ \\hline\n        \\textsc{Bertsum}+Classifier  & 43.23  & 20.22 & 39.60\\\\\n        ~~-interval segments & 43.21 & 20.17 &  39.57 \\\\\n        ~~-trigram blocking  & 42.57  & 19.96 & 39.04\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Results of ablation studies of \\textsc{Bertsum} on CNN/Dailymail test set using  ROUGE $F_1$ (R-1 and R-2 are\n        shorthands for unigram and bigram overlap, R-L  is the\n        longest common subsequence).}\n    \n\\end{table}\n\n    The experimental results on NYT datasets are shown in Table 3.

We evaluate the model on two datasets of scientific papers , Pubmed and arXiv, where it outperforms previous work, both extractive and abstractive models, on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and METEOR scores. We also show that, consistently with our goal, the benefits of our method become stronger as we apply it to longer documents.\nRather surprisingly, an ablation study indicates that the benefits of our model seem to come exclusively from modeling the local context, even for the longest documents.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\renewcommand{\\thefootnote}{\\Roman{footnote}}\nSingle-document summarization is the task of generating a short summary for a given document. Ideally, the generated summaries should be fluent and coherent, and should faithfully maintain the most important information in the source document. \\textcolor{purple}{This is a very challenging task, because it arguably requires an in-depth understanding of the source document, and current automatic solutions are still far from human performance} \\cite{survey}.\\footnote[7]{Sentence coloring and Roman\nnumbering will be explained in the result sub-section 4.5.}\n\nSingle-document summarization can be either extractive or abstractive. Extractive methods typically pick sentences directly from the original document based on their importance, and form the summary as an aggregate of these sentences. Usually, summaries generated in this way have a better performance on fluency and grammar, but they may contain much redundancy and lack in coherence across sentences. In contrast, abstractive methods attempt to mimic what humans do by first extracting content from the source document and then produce new sentences that aggregate and organize the extracted information. Since the sentences are generated from scratch they tend to have a relatively worse performance on fluency and grammar. Furthermore, while abstractive summaries are typically less redundant,  they may end up including misleading or even utterly false statements, because the methods to extract and aggregate information form the source document are still rather noisy. \n\nIn this work, we focus on extracting informative sentences from a given document (without dealing with redundancy), especially when the document is relatively long (e.g., scientific articles).\n\nMost recent works on neural extractive summarization have been rather successful in generating summaries of short news documents (around 650 words/document) \\cite{RNN_beyond} by applying neural Seq2Seq models \\cite{cheng&lapata}. However when it comes to long documents, these models tend to struggle with longer sequences because at each decoding step, the decoder needs to learn to construct a context vector capturing relevant information from all the tokens in the source sequence \\cite{shao}. \n\nLong documents typically cover multiple topics. In general, the longer  a document is, the more topics are discussed. As a matter of fact, when humans write long documents they organize them in chapters, sections etc.. Scientific papers are an example of longer documents and they follow a standard discourse structure describing the problem, methodology, experiments/results, and finally conclusions \\cite{scientific_paper}.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge only one previous work in extractive summarization has explicitly leveraged section information to guide the generation of summaries \\cite{section_supervised}. However, the only information about sections fed into\ntheir sentence classifier is a categorical feature with values like \\textit{Highlight}, \\textit{Abstract},\n\\textit{Introduction}, etc.,\ndepending on which section the sentence appears in.\n\nIn contrast, in order to exploit section information, in this paper we propose to capture a distributed representation of both the global (the whole document) and the local context (e.g., the section/topic) when deciding if a sentence should be included in the summary\n\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n{\\bf (i)} In order to capture the local context, we are the first to apply LSTM-minus to text summarization. LSTM-minus is a method for learning embeddings of text spans, which\nhas achieved good performance in dependency parsing\n\\cite{lstm-minus_propose},  in constituency\nparsing \\cite{lstm-minus_constituency},\nas well as in discourse parsing \\cite{lstm-minus_discourse}. With respect to more traditional methods for capturing\nlocal context, which rely on hierarchical\nstructures, LSTM-minus produces simpler\nmodels i.e. with less parameters, and therefore faster to train and less prone to overfitting.\n{\\bf (ii)} We test our method on the Pubmed and arXiv datasets and results appear to support our goal of effectively summarizing long documents. In particular, while overall we outperform the baseline and previous approaches only by a narrow margin on both datasets, the benefit of our method become much stronger as we apply it to longer documents. \\textcolor{purple}{Furthermore, in an ablation study to assess the relative contributions of the global and the local model we found that, rather surprisingly, the benefits of our model seem to come exclusively from modeling the local context, even for the longest documents.}\\footnotemark[6]\n\\renewcommand{\\thefootnote}{\\arabic{footnote}}\n{\\bf (iii)} In order to evaluate our approach, we have created oracle labels for both Pubmed and arXiv \\cite{discourse_long_document}, by applying a greedy oracle labeling algorithm. The two datasets annotated with extractive labels will be made public.\\footnote{The data and code are available at \\url{https://github.com/Wendy-Xiao/Extsumm_local_global_context}.}\n\n\\section{Related work}\n\\subsection{Extractive summarization}\nTraditional extractive summarization methods are mostly based on explicit surface features \\cite{feature_based}, relying on graph-based methods \\cite{textrank}, or on submodular maximization \\cite{tixier17}. Benefiting from the success of neural sequence models in other NLP tasks, \\newcite{cheng&lapata} propose a novel approach to extractive summarization based on neural networks and continuous sentence features, which outperforms traditional methods on the DailyMail dataset. In particular, they develop a general encoder-decoder architecture, where a CNN is used as sentence encoder, a uni-directional LSTM as document encoder, with another uni-directional LSTM as decoder. To decrease the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy, \\newcite{summarunner} present SummaRuNNer, a simple RNN-based sequence classifier without decoder, outperforming or matching the model of \\cite{cheng&lapata}. They take content, salience, novelty, and position of each sentence into consideration when deciding if a sentence should be included in the extractive summary. Yet, they do not capture any aspect of the topical structure, as we do in this paper. So their approach would arguably suffer when  applied to long documents, likely containing multiple and diverse topics.\n\nWhile SummaRuNNer was tested only on news,  \\newcite{EMNLP2018} carry out  a comprehensive set of experiments with deep learning models of extractive summarization across different domains, i.e. news, personal stories, meetings, and medical articles, as well as across different neural architectures, in order to better understand the general pros and cons of different design choices. They find that non auto-regressive sentence extraction performs as well or better than auto-regressive extraction in all domains, where by auto-regressive sentence extraction they mean using previous predictions to inform future predictions. Furthermore, they find that the Average Word Embedding sentence encoder works at least as well as encoders based on CNN and RNN. In light of these findings, our model is  not auto-regressive and uses the Average Word Embedding encoder.\n\\subsection{Extractive summarization on Scientific papers}\nResearch on summarizing scientific articles has a long history \\cite{survey_summarization}. Earlier on, it was realized   that summarizing scientific papers requires different approaches than what was used for summarizing news articles, due to differences in document length, writing style and rhetorical structure. For instance, \\cite{scientific_article_summarization_02} presented a supervised Naive Bayes classifier to select content from a scientific paper based on the rhetorical status of each sentence (e.g., whether it specified a research goal, or some generally accepted scientific background knowledge, etc.). \nMore recently, researchers have extended this work by applying more sophisticated classifiers to identify more fine-grain rhetorical categories, as well as by exploiting citation contexts. \\newcite{2013-discourse} propose the CoreSC discourse-driven content, which relies on CRFs and SVMs, to classify the discourse categories (e.g. Background, Hypothesis, Motivation, etc.) at the sentence level.  The recent work most similar to ours is \\cite{section_supervised} where, in order to determine whether a sentence should be included in the summary, they directly use the section  each sentence appears in as a categorical feature with  values like Highlight, Abstract, Introduction, etc.. In this paper, instead of using sections as categorical features, we rely on a distributed representation of the semantic information within each section, as the local context of each sentence. In a very different line of work, \\newcite{cohan-2015-scientific} form the summary  by also exploiting information on how the target paper is cited in  other papers. Currently, we do not use any information from citation contexts.\n\n\\subsection{Datasets for long documents}\n\\begin{table}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n    \\hline\n    Datasets & \\# docs & avg. doc. length&  avg. summ. length\\\\\n    \\hline\n      CNN &92K& 656& 43\\\\\n      \\hline\n        Daily Mail & 219K & 693 & 52\\\\\n        \\hline\n        NY Times & 655K & 530 & 38\\\\\n        \\hline\n        PubMed & 133K & 3016& 203\\\\\n        \\hline\n        arXiv & 215K & 4938 & 220 \\\\\n        \\hline\n     \\end{tabular}}\n    \\caption{Comparison of news datasets and scientific paper datasets\\cite{discourse_long_document}, the length is in terms of the number of words}\n    \\label{tab:dataset}\n\\end{table}\n\\newcite{summary_dataset} provide a comprehensive overview of the current  datasets for summarization. Noticeably, most of the larger-scale summarization datasets consists of relatively short documents, like CNN/DailyMail \\cite{RNN_beyond} and New York Times \\cite{nyt}. One exception is \\cite{discourse_long_document} that recently introduce two large-scale datasets of long and structured scientific papers obtained from arXiv and PubMed. These two new datasets contain much longer documents than all the news datasets (See Table \\ref{tab:dataset}) and are therefore ideal test-beds for the method we present in this paper.\n\n\\subsection{Neural Abstractive summarization on long documents}\nWhile most current neural abstractive summarization models have focused on summarizing relatively short news articles (e.g., \\cite{get_to_the_point}), few researchers have started to investigate the summarization of longer documents by exploiting their natural structure. \n\\newcite{agents} present an encoder-decoder architecture to address the challenges of representing a long document for abstractive summarization. The encoding task is divided across several collaborating agents, each is responsible for a subsection of text through a multi-layer LSTM with word attention.\nTheir model seems however overly complicated when it comes to the extractive summarization task, where word attention is arguably much less critical. So, we do not consider this model further in this paper. \n\n\\newcite{discourse_long_document} also propose a model for abstractive summarization taking the structure of documents into consideration with a hierarchical approach, and test it on longer documents with section information, i.e. scientific papers. In particular, they apply a hierarchical encoder at the word and section levels. Then, in the decoding step, they combine the word attention and section attention to obtain a context vector. \n\nThis approach to capture discourse structure is however quite limited both in general and especially when you consider its application to extractive summarization. First, their hierarchical method has a large number of parameters and it is therefore  slow to train and likely prone to overfitting\\footnote{To address this, they only process the first 2000 words of each document, by setting a hard threshold in their implementation, and therefore loosing information.}. Secondly, it  does not take the global context of the whole document into account, which may arguably be critical in extractive methods, when deciding on the salience of a sentence (or even a word). The extractive summarizer we present in this paper tries to address these limitations by adopting the  parameter lean LSTM-minus method, and by explicitly modeling the global context.\n\\subsection{LSTM-Minus}\nThe LSTM-Minus method is first proposed in \\cite{lstm-minus_propose} as a novel way to learn sentence segment embeddings for graph-based dependency parsing, i.e. estimating the most likely dependency tree given an input sentence. For each dependency pair, they divide a sentence into three segments (prefix, infix and suffix), and LSTM-Minus is used to represent each segment. They apply a single LSTM to the whole sentence and  use the difference between two hidden states $h_j-h_i$ to represent the segment from word  $w_i$  to word $w_j$. This enables  their model to learn segment embeddings from information both outside and inside the segments and thus enhancing their model ability to access to sentence-level information. The intuition behind the method is that each hidden vector $h_t$ can capture useful information before and including the word $v_t$. \n\nShortly after, \\newcite{lstm-minus_constituency} use the same method on the task of constituency parsing, as the representation of a sentence span, extending the original uni-directional LSTM-Minus to the bi-directional case. \nMore recently, inspired by the success of LSTM-Minus in both dependency and constituency parsing, \\newcite{lstm-minus_discourse} extend the technique to discourse parsing. They propose a two-stage model consisting of an intra-sentential parser and a multi-sentential parser, learning contextually informed representations of\nconstituents with LSTM-Minus, at the sentence and document level, respectively. \n\nSimilarly, in this paper, when deciding if a sentence should be included in the summary, the local context of that sentence is captured by applying LSTM-Minus at the document level, to represent the sub-sequence of sentences of the document (i.e., the topic/section) the target sentence belongs to.\n\n\\section{Our Model}\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{model_structure_section_v3.png}\n    \\caption{The structure of our model, $se_i,sr_i$ represent the sentence embedding and sentence representation of sentence $i$, respectively. The binary decision of whether the sentence should be included in the summary is based on the sentence itself (A), the whole document (B) and the current topic (C). The document representation is simply the concatenation of the last hidden states of the forward and backward RNNs, while the topic segment representation is computed by applying LSTM-Minus, as shown in detail in the left panel (Detail of C).}\n    \\label{fig:model}\n\\end{figure*}\nIn this work, we propose an extractive model for long documents, incorporating local and global context information, motivated by natural topic-oriented structure of human-written long documents. The architecture of our model is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:model}, each sentence is visited sequentially in the original document order, and a corresponding confidence score is computed expressing whether the sentence should be included in the extractive summary.\nOur model comprises three components: the sentence encoder, the document encoder and the sentence classifier.\n\\subsection{Sentence Encoder}\nThe goal of the sentence encoder is mapping sequences of word embeddings to a fixed length vector (See bottom center of Figure \\ref{fig:model}). There are several common %architectures \nmethods to embed sentences. For  extractive summarization, RNN were used in \\cite{summarunner}, CNN in \\cite{cheng&lapata}, and Average Word Embedding in \\cite{EMNLP2018}. \\newcite{EMNLP2018} experiment with all the three methods and conclude that Word Embedding Averaging is as good or better than either RNNs or CNNs for sentence embedding across different domains and summarizer architectures. Thus, we use the Average Word Embedding as our sentence encoder, by which a sentence embedding is simply the average of its word embeddings, i.e. \n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nse=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{w_0}^{w_n}emb(w_i), se\\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{emb}}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nBesides, we also tried the popular pre-trained BERT sentence embedding \\cite{bert}, but initial results were rather poor. So we do not pursue this possibility any further. \n\n\\subsection{Document Encoder}\nAt the document level, a bi-directional recurrent neural network \\cite{bi-rnn} is often used to encode all the sentences sequentially forward and backward, with such model achieving remarkable success in machine translation \\cite{bi-rnn_mt}. As units, we selected gated recurrent units (GRU) \\cite{GRU_propose}, in light of favorable results shown in \\cite{GRU_why}.  The GRU is represented \nwith the  standard  reset, update, and new gates.\n\nThe output of the bi-directional GRU for each sentence $t$ comprises two hidden states, $h^f_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{hid}},h^b_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{hid}}$ as forward and backward hidden state, respectively.\\\\\n\\textbf{A. Sentence representation} As shown in Figure \\ref{fig:model}(A), for each sentence $t$, the sentence representation is the concatenation of both backward and forward hidden state of that sentence.  $$sr_t = (h^f_t:h^b_t),   sr_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{hid}*2}$$ In this way, the sentence representation not only represents the current sentence, but also partially covers contextual information both before and after this sentence. \\\\\n\\textbf{B. Document representation}\nThe document representation provides global information on the whole document. It is computed as the concatenation of the final state of the forward and backward GRU, labeled as B in Figure \\ref{fig:model}. \\cite{selection_emnlp2018}\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nd = (h^f_{n}:h^b_0), d\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{hid}*2}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\textbf{C. Topic segment representation}\nTo capture the local context of each sentence, namely the information of the topic segment that sentence falls into, we apply the LSTM-Minus method\\footnote{In the original paper, LSTMs were used as recurrent unit. Although we use GRUs here, for consistency with previous work, we still call the method LSTM-Minus}, a method for learning embeddings of text spans. LSTM-Minus is shown in detail in Figure 1 (left panel C), each topic segment is represented as the subtraction between the hidden states of the start and the end of that topic. As illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:model}, the representation for section 2 of the sample document (containing three sections and eight sentences overall) can be computed as $[f_5-f_2,b_3-b_6]$, where $f_5, f_2$ are the forward hidden states of sentence $5$ and $2$, respectively, while $b_3, b_6$ are the backward hidden states of sentence $3$ and $6$, respectively. In general, the topic segment representation  $l_t$ for segment $t$ is computed as:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nf_t&=& h^f_{end_t}- h^f_{start_t-1}, f_t \\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{hid}}\\\\\nb_t&=& h^b_{start_t}- h^b_{end_t+1}, b_t \\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{hid}}\\\\\nl_t&=& (f_t:b_t), l_t \\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{hid}*2}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nwhere $start_t, end_t$ is the index of the beginning and the end of topic $t$, $f_t$ and $b_t$ denote the topic segment representation of forward and backward, respectively. The final representation of topic $t$ is the concatenation of forward and backward representation $l_t$. To obtain $f_i$ and $b_i$, we utilize subtraction between GRU hidden vectors of $start_t$ and $end_t$, and we pad the hidden states with zero vectors both in the beginning and the end, to ensure the index can not be out of bound. The intuition behind this process is that the GRUs can keep previous useful information in their\nmemory cell by exploiting reset, update, and new gates to decide how to utilize and update the memory of previous information. In this way, we can represent the contextual information within each topic segment for all the sentences in that segment.\n\\subsection{Decoder}\nOnce we have obtained a representation for the sentence, for its topic segment (i.e., local context) and for the document (i.e., global context), these three factors are combined to make a final prediction $p_i$ on whether the sentence should be included in the summary. We consider two ways in which these three factors can be combined.\\\\\n\\textbf{Concatenation} We can simply concatenate the vectors of these three factors as, \n$$input_i = (d:l_t:sr_i), input_i \\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{hid}*6}$$\nwhere sentence $i$ is part of the topic $t$, and $input_i$ is the representation of sentence $i$ with topic segment information and global context information.\\\\\n\\textbf{Attentive context} As local context and global context are all contextual information of the given sentence, we use an attention mechanism to decide the weight of each context vector, represented as\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nscore^d_i &=& v^Ttanh(W_a (d:sr_i))\\\\\nscore^l_i &=& v^Ttanh(W_a (l_t:sr_i))\\\\\nweight^d_i &=& \\frac{score^d_i}{score^d_i+score^l_i}\\\\\nweight^l_i &=& \\frac{score^l_i}{score^d_i+score^l_i}\\\\\ncontext_i &=& weight^d_i*d+weight^l_i*l_t\\\\\ninput_i &=& (sr_i:context_i), input_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{hid}*4}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nwhere the $context_i$ is the weighted context vector of each sentence $i$, and assume sentence $i$ is in topic $t$.\n\nThen there is a final multi-layer perceptron(MLP) followed with a sigmoid activation function indicating the confidence score for selecting each sentence: \n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nh_i &=& Dropout(ReLU(W_{mlp} input_i+b_{mlp}))\\\\\np_i &=& \\sigma(W_h h_i +b_h)\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n\\section{Experiments}\nTo validate our method, we set up experiments on the two scientific paper datasets (arXiv and PubMed). With ROUGE and METEOR scores as automatic evaluation metrics, we compare with previous works, both abstractive and extractive.\n\\subsection{Training}\nThe weighted negative log-likelihood is minimized, where the weight is computed as $w_{pos} = \\frac{\\# negative}{\\# postive}$, to solve the problem of highly imbalanced data (typical in extractive summarization).\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n    \\mathcal{L} &=& -\\sum_{d=1}^{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_d}(w_{pos} * y_i \\log p(y_i|\\mathbf{W},b) \\\\\n    &+& (1-y_i)\\log p(y_i|\\mathbf{W},b))\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nwhere $y_i$ represent the ground-truth label of sentence $i$, with $y_i=1$ meaning  sentence $i$ is in the gold-standard extract summary. \n\n\\subsection{Extractive Label Generation}\nIn the Pubmed and arXiv datasets, the extractive summaries are missing. So we follow the work of \\cite{EMNLP2018} on extractive summary labeling, constructing gold label sequences by greedily optimizing ROUGE-1 on the gold-standard abstracts, which are available for each article. \\footnote{For this, we use a popular python implementation of the ROUGE score to build the oracle. Code can be found here, \\url{https://pypi.org/project/py-rouge/}} The algorithm is shown in Appendix A.\n\\subsection{Implementation Details}\nWe train our model using the Adam optimizer \\cite{adam} with learning rate $0.0001$ and a drop out rate of 0.3. We use a mini-batch with a batch size of 32 documents, and the size of the GRU hidden states is 300. For word embeddings, we use GloVe \\cite{glove} with dimension 300, pre-trained on the Wikipedia and Gigaword. The vocabulary size of our model is 50000. All the above parameters were set based on \\cite{EMNLP2018} without any fine-tuning. Again following \\cite{EMNLP2018}, we train each model for 50 epochs, and the best model is selected with early stopping on the validation set according to Rouge-2 F-score.\n\\subsection{Models for Comparison}\nWe perform a systematic comparison with previous work in extractive summarization. For completeness, we also compare with recent neural abstractive approaches. In all the experiments, we use the same train/val/test splitting. \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\setlength\\itemsep{-0.3em}\n\\item Traditional extractive summarization models: SumBasic \\cite{sumbasic}, LSA \\cite{lsa}, and LexRank \\cite{lexrank}\n\\item Neural abstractive summarization models: Attn-Seq2Seq \\cite{RNN_beyond}, Pntr-Gen-Seq2Seq \\cite{get_to_the_point} and Discourse-aware \\cite{discourse_long_document}\n\\item Neural extractive summarization models: \n    Cheng\\&Lapata \\cite{cheng&lapata} and SummaRuNNer \\cite{summarunner}.

Summaries are generated by selecting the top ranked sentences by model probability $p(y_i|\\mathbb{W},b)$, until the length limit is met or exceeded. Based on the average length of abstracts in these two datasets, we set the length limit to 200 words. We use ROUGE scores\\footnote{We use a modified version of rouge\\_papier, a python wrapper of ROUGE-1.5.5, \\url{https://github.com/kedz/rouge_papier}. The command line is 'Perl ROUGE-1.5.5 -e data -a -n 2 -r 1000 -f A -z SPL  config\\_file'} \\cite{ROUGE} and METEOR scores\\footnote{We use default setting of METEOR.} \\cite{meteor} between the model results and ground-truth abstractive summaries as evaluation metric. The unigram and bigram overlap (ROUGE-1,2) are intended to measure the informativeness, while longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L) captures fluency to some extent \\cite{cheng&lapata}. METEOR was originally proposed to evaluate translation systems by measuring the alignment between the system output and reference translations. As such, it can also be used as an automatic evaluation metric for summarization \\cite{EMNLP2018}.\n\\begin{figure*}[htbp!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{long_doc_large.png}\n    \\caption{A Comparison between our model, SummaRuNNer and Oracle when applied to documents with increasing length, left-up: ROUGE-1 on Pubmed dataset, right-up: ROUGE-2 on Pubmed dataset, left-down: ROUGE-1 on arXiv dataset, right-down: ROUGE-2 on arXiv dataset}\n    \\label{fig:long docs}\n\\end{figure*} \\squeezeup\n\nThe performance of all models on  arXiv  and Pubmed is shown in Table \\ref{tab:result-arXiv} and Table \\ref{tab:result-pubmed}, respectively. Follow the work \\cite{EMNLP2018}, we use the approximate randomization as the statistical significance test method \\cite{statsig} with a  Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, at the confidence level 0.01 ($p<0.01$).  \nAs we can see in these tables, on both datasets, the neural extractive models outperforms  the traditional extractive models on informativeness (ROUGE-1,2) by a wide margin, but results are mixed on ROUGE-L. Presumably, this is due to the neural training process, which relies on a goal standard based on ROUGE-1. Exploring other training schemes and/or a combination of traditional and neural approaches is left as future work. Similarly, the neural extractive models also dominate the neural abstractive models on ROUGE-1,2, but these abstractive models tend to have the highest ROUGE-L scores, possibly because they are trained directly  on gold standard abstract summaries.\n\nCompared with other neural extractive models, our models (both with attentive context and concatenation decoder) have better performances on all three ROUGE scores, as well as METEOR. In particular, the improvements over the Baseline model show that a combination of local and global contextual information does help to identify the most important sentences (more on this in the next section). Interestingly, just the Baseline model already achieves a slightly better performance than  previous works; possibly because the auto-regressive approach used in those models is  even more detrimental for long documents.\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:long docs} shows the most important result of our analysis: the benefits of our method, explicitly designed %to capture  global and local context for dealing with\nto deal with longer documents, do actually become stronger as we apply it to longer documents. As it can be seen in Figure \\ref{fig:long docs}, the performance gain of our model with respect to current state-of-the-art extractive summarizer is more pronounced for documents with $>= 3000$ words in both datasets. \n\nFinally, the result of Lead (Table \\ref{tab:result-arXiv}, \\ref{tab:result-pubmed}) shows that scientific papers have less position bias than news; i.e., the first  sentences of these papers are not a good choice to form an extractive summary. \n\nAs a teaser for the potential and challenges that still face our approach, its output (i.e., the extracted sentences) {\\it when applied to this paper} is colored in red and the order in which the sentences are extracted is marked with the Roman numbering. If we set the summary length limit to the length of our abstract, the first five sentences in the conclusions section are extracted. If we increase the length to 200 words, two more sentences are extracted, which do seem to provide useful complementary information. Not surprisingly, some redundancy is present, as dealing explicitly with redundancy is not a goal of our current proposal and left as future work.\n\\subsection{Ablation Study}\n\n\\begin{table}[htb!]\n    \\centering\n    \\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{|llll|}\n    \\hline\n    \n      \\it{Model}   & \\it{ROUGE-1(+l/+g)} & \\it{ROUGE-2(+l/+g)} & \\it{ROUGE-L(+l/+g)} \\\\\n      \\hhline{====}\n      BSL & 44.29 (na/na)&19.17 (na/na) &30.89 (na/na)\\\\\n      \\hline\n      BSL+l & \\textbf{44.85} (+.56/na) & \\textbf{19.77} (+.6/na) & \\textbf{31.51} (+.62/na)\\\\\n      \\hline\n      BSL+g & 44.06 (na/-.23) &18.83 (na/-.34) & 30.53 (na/-.36)\\\\\n      \\hline\n      BSL+l+g & \\textbf{44.81} (+.75/-.04) &\\textbf{19.74} (+.91/-.03) &\\textbf{31.48} (+.95/-.03)\\\\\n      \\hhline{====}\n    BSL &43.85 (na/na) & 15.94 (na/na) & 28.13 (na/na)\\\\\n      \\hline\n      BSL+l & \\textbf{44.65} (+.8/na) & \\textbf{16.75} (+.81/na)& \\textbf{28.99} (+.85/na)\\\\\n      \\hline\n      BSL+g &43.70 (na/-.15) & 15.74 (na/-.2) & 27.67 (na/-.46)\\\\\n      \\hline\n      BSL+l+g & \\textbf{44.64} (+.94/-.01)&\\textbf{16.69} (+.95/-.06)&\\textbf{28.96} (+1.29/-.03)\\\\\n      \\hline\n      \n      \n    \\end{tabular}}\n    \\caption[Ablation study on Pubmed]{Ablation study on the Pubmed dataset, with all the documents(up) and a subset of long documents (down, $>6000$ words).

And the improvement is even greater when we only consider long documents. Rather surprisingly,  this is not the case for the global context. Adding a representation of the whole document (i.e. global context) never significantly improves performance. In essence, it seems that all the  benefits of our model come exclusively from modeling  the  local  context,  even  for  the  longest documents. Further investigation of this finding is left as future work.\n\n\\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\n\\renewcommand{\\thefootnote}{\\Roman{footnote}}\n\\textcolor{purple}{In this paper, we propose a novel extractive summarization model especially designed for long documents, by incorporating the local context within each topic, along with the global context of the whole document.}\\footnotemark[2]  \\textcolor{purple}{Our approach integrates recent findings on neural extractive summarization in a parameter lean and modular architecture.}\\footnotemark[3]\n\\textcolor{purple}{We evaluate our model and compare with previous works in both extractive and abstractive summarization on two large scientific paper datasets,\nwhich contain documents that are much longer than in previously used corpora.}\\footnotemark[4] \\textcolor{purple}{Our model not only achieves state-of-the-art on these two datasets, but in an additional experiment, in which we consider documents with increasing length, it becomes more competitive for longer documents.}\\footnotemark[5]\n\\textcolor{purple}{We also ran an ablation study to assess the relative contribution of the global and local components of our approach. }\\footnotemark[1]\nRather surprisingly, it appears that the benefits of our model come only from modeling the local context.\n\nFor future work, we initially intend to investigate neural methods to deal with redundancy.\nThen, it could be beneficial to integrate explicit features, like sentence position and salience, into our neural approach.

Instead of following the commonly used framework of extracting sentences individually and modeling the relationship between sentences, we formulate the extractive summarization task as a \\emph{semantic text matching} problem, in which a source document and candidate summaries will be (extracted from the original text) matched in a semantic space. Notably, this paradigm shift to semantic matching framework is \\emph{well-grounded} in our comprehensive analysis of the inherent gap between sentence-level and summary-level extractors based on the property of the dataset.\n\nBesides, even instantiating the framework with a simple form of a matching model, we have driven the state-of-the-art extractive result on CNN/DailyMail to a new level (44.41 in ROUGE-1). Experiments on the other five datasets also show the effectiveness of the matching framework.  We believe the power of this matching-based summarization framework has not been fully exploited. To encourage more instantiations in the future,  we have released our codes, processed dataset, as well as generated summaries in {\\url{https://github.com/maszhongming/MatchSum}}.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe task of automatic text summarization aims to compress a textual document to a shorter highlight while keeping salient information on the original text.\nIn this paper, we focus on extractive summarization since it usually generates semantically and grammatically correct sentences \\cite{dong2018banditsum,nallapati2017summarunner} and computes faster.\n\nCurrently, most of the neural extractive summarization systems score and extract sentences (or smaller semantic unit \\cite{xu2019discourse}) one by one from the original text, model the relationship between the sentences, and then select several sentences to form a summary. \\citet{cheng2016neural, nallapati2017summarunner} formulate the extractive summarization task as a sequence labeling problem and solve it with an encoder-decoder framework. These models make independent binary decisions for each sentence, resulting in high redundancy. A natural way to address the above problem is to introduce an auto-regressive decoder \\cite{chen2018fast, jadhav2018extractive, zhou2018neural}, allowing the scoring operations of different sentences to influence on each other. Trigram Blocking \\cite{paulus2017deep,liu2019text}, as a more popular method recently, has the same motivation. At the stage of selecting sentences to form a summary, it will skip the sentence that has trigram overlapping with the previously selected sentences. Surprisingly, this simple method of removing duplication brings a remarkable performance improvement on CNN/DailyMail.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{./Figures/matchsum.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textsc{MatchSum} framework. We match the contextual representations of the document with gold summary and candidate summaries (extracted from the document). Intuitively, better candidate summaries should be semantically closer to the document, while the gold summary should be the closest.}\n    \\label{fig:framework}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe above systems of modeling the relationship between sentences are essentially sentence-level extractors, rather than considering the semantics of the entire summary. This makes them more inclined to select highly generalized sentences while ignoring the coupling of multiple sentences. \\citet{narayan2018ranking,bae2019summary} utilize reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve summary-level scoring, but still limited to the architecture of sentence-level summarizers.\n\nTo better understand the advantages and limitations of sentence-level and summary-level approaches, we conduct an analysis on six benchmark datasets (in Section \\ref{sec:investigation}) to explore the characteristics of these two methods. We find that there is indeed an inherent gap between the two approaches across these datasets, which motivates us to propose the following summary-level method.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel summary-level framework (\\textsc{MatchSum}, Figure \\ref{fig:framework}) and conceptualize extractive summarization as a semantic text matching problem. The principle idea is that a good summary should be more semantically similar as a whole to the source document than the unqualified summaries.\nSemantic text matching is an important research problem to estimate semantic similarity between a source and a target text fragment, which has been applied in many fields, such as information retrieval \\cite{mitra2017learning}, question answering \\cite{yih2013question, severyn2015learning}, natural language inference \\cite{wang2016learning, wang2017bilateral} and so on. One of the most conventional approaches to semantic text matching is to learn a vector representation for each text fragment, and then apply typical similarity metrics to compute the matching scores.\n\nSpecific to extractive summarization, we propose a Siamese-BERT architecture to compute the similarity between the source document and the candidate summary. Siamese BERT leverages the pre-trained\nBERT \\cite{devlin2019bert} in a Siamese network structure \\cite{bromley1994signature, hoffer2015deep, reimers2019sentence} to derive semantically meaningful text embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity.\nA good summary has the highest similarity among a set of candidate summaries.\n\nWe evaluate the proposed matching framework and perform significance testing on a range of benchmark datasets. Our model outperforms strong baselines significantly in all cases and improve the state-of-the-art extractive result on CNN/DailyMail. Besides, we design experiments to observe the gains brought by our framework.\n\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\n\n1) Instead of scoring and extracting sentences one by one to form a summary, we formulate extractive summarization as a semantic text matching problem and propose a novel summary-level framework. Our approach bypasses the difficulty of summary-level optimization by contrastive learning, that is, a good summary  should  be  more  semantically  similar to the source document than the unqualified summaries.\n\n2) We conduct an analysis to investigate whether extractive models must do summary-level extraction based on the property of dataset, and attempt to quantify the inherent gap between sentence-level and summary-level methods.\n\n3) Our proposed framework has achieved superior performance compared with strong baselines on six benchmark datasets. Notably, we obtain \\textit{a state-of-the-art extractive result on CNN/DailyMail (44.41 in ROUGE-1) by only using the base version of BERT}. Moreover, we seek to observe where the performance gain of our model comes from.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\subsection{Extractive Summarization}\n\nRecent research work on extractive summarization spans a large range of approaches.\nThese work usually instantiate their encoder-decoder framework by choosing RNN \\cite{zhou2018neural}, Transformer \\cite{zhong2019closer, wang2019exploring} or GNN \\cite{wang2020heterogeneous} as encoder, non-auto-regressive \\cite{narayan2018ranking, arumae2018reinforced} or auto-regressive decoders \\cite{jadhav2018extractive, liu2019text}. Despite the effectiveness, these models are essentially sentence-level extractors with individual scoring process favor the highest scoring sentence, which probably is not the optimal one to form summary\\footnote{We will quantify this phenomenon in Section \\ref{sec:investigation}.}.\n\nThe application of RL provides a means of summary-level scoring and brings improvement \\cite{narayan2018ranking, bae2019summary}. However, these efforts are still limited to auto-regressive or non-auto-regressive architectures. Besides, in the non-neural approaches, the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) method can also be used for summary-level scoring \\cite{wan2015multi}.\n\nIn addition, there is some work to solve extractive summarization from a semantic perspective before this paper, such as concept coverage \\cite{gillick2009scalable}, reconstruction \\cite{miao2016language} and maximize semantic volume \\cite{yogatama2015extractive}.\n\n\\subsection{Two-stage Summarization}\nRecent studies \\cite{alyguliyev2009two, galanis2010extractive, zhang2019pretraining} have attempted to build two-stage document summarization systems. Specific to extractive summarization, the first stage is usually to extract some fragments of the original text, and the second stage is to select or modify on the basis of these fragments.\n\n\\citet{chen2018fast} and \\citet{bae2019summary} follow a hybrid \\textit{extract-then-rewrite} architecture, with policy-based RL to bridge the two networks together.\n\\citet{lebanoff2019scoring,xu-durrett-2019-neural,mendes2019jointly} focus on the \\textit{extract-then-compress} learning paradigm, namely compressive summarization, which will first train an extractor for content selection.\nOur model can be viewed as an \\textit{extract-then-match} framework, which also employs a  sentence extractor to prune unnecessary information.\n\n\\section{Sentence-Level or Summary-Level? A Dataset-dependent Analysis}\n\\label{sec:investigation}\n\nAlthough previous work has pointed out the weakness of sentence-level extractors, there is no systematic analysis towards the following questions:\n1) For extractive summarization, is the \\emph{summary-level extractor} better than the \\emph{sentence-level extractor}?\n2) Given a dataset, which extractor should we choose based on the characteristics of the data, and what is the inherent gap between these two extractors?\n\nIn this section, we investigate the gap between sentence-level and summary-level methods on six benchmark datasets, which can instruct us to search for an effective learning framework. It is worth noting that the sentence-level extractor we use here doesn't include a redundancy removal process so that we can estimate the effect of the summary-level extractor on redundancy elimination.\nNotably, the analysis method to estimate the theoretical effectiveness presented in this section is generalized and can be applicable to any summary-level approach.\n\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.1}\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n    \\center \\footnotesize\n    \\tabcolsep0.13 in\n    \\begin{tabular}{lllcccccc}\n    \\toprule\n    \\multicolumn{1}{l}{\\multirow{2}[1]{*}{\\textbf{Datasets}}} &\n    \\multicolumn{1}{l}{\\multirow{2}[1]{*}{\\textbf{Source}}} &\n    \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\multirow{2}[1]{*}{\\textbf{Type}}} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{\\# Pairs}} &\n    \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{\\# Tokens}} &\n    \\multicolumn{1}{l}{\\multirow{2}[1]{*}{\\textbf{\\# Ext}}} \\\\\n     & & & Train & Valid & Test & Doc. & Sum. & \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    Reddit &  Social Media & SDS & 41,675 & 645 & 645 &  482.2 & 28.0 & 2\\\\\n    XSum  &  News  & SDS & 203,028 & 11,273 & 11,332 & 430.2 & 23.3 & 2\\\\\n    CNN/DM &  News  & SDS & 287,084 & 13,367 & 11,489 & 766.1 & 58.2 & 3 \\\\\n    WikiHow & Knowledge Base & SDS &  168,126 & 6,000 & 6,000 & 580.8 & 62.6 & 4\\\\\n    PubMed &  Scientific Paper & SDS & 83,233 & 4,946 & 5,025 & 444.0 & 209.5 & 6\\\\\n    Multi-News &  News  & MDS & 44,972 & 5,622 & 5,622 & 487.3 & 262.0 & 9\\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}%\n    \\caption{Datasets overview.

And as $z$ increases ($\\hat{C}$ gets lower rankings), we could find more candidate summaries whose sentence-level score is higher than best-summary, which leads to the learning difficulty for sentence-level extractors.\n\nSince the appearance of the pearl-summary will bring challenges to sentence-level extractors, we attempt to investigate the proportion of pearl-summary in different datasets on six benchmark datasets. A detailed description of these datasets is displayed in Table~\\ref{tab:datasets}.\n\nAs demonstrated in Figure \\ref{fig:dataset_fusion}, we can observe that for all datasets,  most of the best-summaries are not made up of the highest-scoring sentences.\nSpecifically, for \\texttt{CNN/DM}, only 18.9\\% of best-summaries are not pearl-summary, indicating sentence-level extractors will easily fall into a local optimization, missing better candidate summaries.\n\nDifferent from \\texttt{CNN/DM}, \\texttt{PubMed} is most suitable for sentence-level summarizers, because most of best-summary sets are not pearl-summary.\nAdditionally, it is challenging to achieve good performance on \\texttt{WikiHow} and \\texttt{Multi-News} without a summary-level learning process, as these two datasets are most evenly distributed, that is, the appearance of pearl-summary makes the selection of the best-summary more complicated.\n\nIn conclusion, the proportion of the pearl-summaries in all the best-summaries is a property to characterize a dataset, which will affect our choices of summarization extractors.\n\n\\subsection{Inherent Gap between Sentence-Level and Summary-Level Extractors}\n\\label{sec:inherent gap}\nAbove analysis has explicated that the summary-level method is better than the sentence-level method because it can pick out pearl-summaries, but how much improvement can it bring given a specific dataset?\n\nBased on the definition of Eq. \\eqref{eq:g_sen} and \\eqref{eq:g_set}, we can characterize the upper bound of the sentence-level and summary-level summarization systems for a document $D$ as:\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\alpha^{sen}(D) &= \\max_{C\\in \\mathcal{C}_D}\\mathrm{g}^{sen}(C), \\\\\n    \\alpha^{sum}(D) &= \\max_{C\\in \\mathcal{C}_D}\\mathrm{g}^{sum}(C),\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\mathcal{C}_D$ is the set of candidate summaries extracted from $D$.\n\nThen, we quantify the potential gain for a document $D$  by calculating the difference between $\\alpha^{sen}(D)$ and $\\alpha^{sum}(D)$:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\Delta(D) = \\alpha^{sum}(D) - \\alpha^{sen}(D).\n\\end{align}\nFinally, a dataset-level potential gain can be obtained as:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\Delta(\\mathcal{D}) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\sum_{D\\in \\mathcal{D}}\\Delta(D),\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}$ represents a specific dataset and $|\\mathcal{D}|$ is the number of documents in this dataset.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{./Figures/gap.pdf}\n    \\caption{$\\Delta(\\mathcal{D})$ for different datasets.}\n    \\label{fig:delta}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe can see from Figure \\ref{fig:delta}, the performance gain of the summary-level method varies with the dataset and has an improvement at a maximum 4.7 on \\texttt{CNN/DM}. From Figure \\ref{fig:delta} and Table \\ref{tab:datasets}, we can find the performance gain is related to the length of reference summary for different datasets. In the case of short summaries (\\texttt{Reddit} and \\texttt{XSum}), the perfect identification of pearl-summaries does not lead to much improvement. Similarly, multiple sentences in a long summary (\\texttt{PubMed} and \\texttt{Multi-News}) already have a large degree of semantic overlap, making the improvement of the summary-level method relatively small. But for a medium-length summary (\\texttt{CNN/DM} and \\texttt{WikiHow}, about 60 words), the summary-level learning process is rewarding. We will discuss this performance gain with specific models in Section \\ref{sec:Analyzing}.\n\n\\section{Summarization as Matching}\n\\label{sec:model}\n\nThe above quantitative analysis suggests that for most of the datasets, sentence-level extractors are inherently unaware of pearl-summary, so obtaining the best-summary is difficult. To better utilize the above characteristics of the data, we propose a summary-level framework which could score and extract a summary directly.\n\nSpecifically, we formulate the extractive summarization task as a semantic text matching problem,   in  which  a  source  document and  candidate  summaries  will  be  (extracted from the original text) matched in a semantic space.\nThe following section will detail how we instantiate our proposed matching summarization framework by using a simple siamese-based architecture.\n\n\\subsection{Siamese-BERT}\n\nInspired by siamese network structure \\cite{bromley1994signature}, we construct a Siamese-BERT architecture to match the document $D$ and the candidate summary $C$. Our Siamese-BERT consists of two BERTs with tied-weights and a cosine-similarity layer during the inference phase.\n\nUnlike the modified BERT used in \\cite{liu2019fine,bae2019summary}, we directly use the original BERT to derive the semantically meaningful embeddings from document $D$ and candidate summary $C$ since we need not obtain the sentence-level representation.\nThus, we use the vector of the `\\texttt{[CLS]}' token from the top BERT layer as the representation of a document or summary.\nLet $\\mathbf{r}_D$ and $\\mathbf{r}_C$ denote the embeddings of the document $D$ and candidate summary $C$. Their similarity score is measured by $f(D,C)=\\mathrm{cosine}(\\mathbf{r}_D,\\mathbf{r}_C)$.\n\nIn order to fine-tune Siamese-BERT, we use a margin-based triplet loss to update the weights.\nIntuitively, the gold summary $C^*$ should be semantically closest to the source document, which is the first principle our loss should follow:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{1} = \\max(0,f(D,C)-f(D,C^*) +\\gamma_1),\n\\end{align}\nwhere $C$ is the candidate summary in $D$ and $\\gamma_1$ is a margin value. Besides, we also design a pairwise margin loss for all the candidate summaries. We sort all candidate summaries in descending order of ROUGE scores with the gold summary. Naturally, the candidate pair with a larger ranking gap should have a larger margin, which is the second principle to design our loss function:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{2} = \\max&(0, f(D,C_j)-f(D,C_i) \\\\\n    &+(j-i)*\\gamma_2) \\quad  (i < j),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $C_i$ represents the candidate summary ranked $i$ and $\\gamma_2$ is a hyperparameter used to distinguish between good and bad candidate summaries. Finally, our margin-based triplet loss can be written as:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{1} + \\mathcal{L}_{2}.\n\\end{align}\nThe basic idea is to let the gold summary have the highest matching score, and at the same time,  a better candidate summary should obtain a higher score compared with the unqualified candidate summary. Figure \\ref{fig:framework} illustrate this idea.\n\nIn the inference phase, we formulate extractive summarization as a task to search for the best summary among all the candidates $\\mathcal{C}$ extracted from the document $D$.\n\\begin{align}\n    \\hat{C} = \\mathop{\\arg\\,\\max}_{C\\in \\mathcal{C}} f(D, C). \\label{eq:search}\n\\end{align}\n\n\\subsection{Candidates Pruning}\n\n\\paragraph{Curse of Combination}\nThe matching idea is more intuitive while it suffers from combinatorial explosion problems. For example, how could we determine the size of the candidate summary set or should we score all possible candidates?\nTo alleviate these difficulties, we propose a simple candidate pruning strategy.\n\nConcretely, we introduce a \\textit{content selection module} to pre-select salient sentences.\nThe module learns to assign each sentence a salience score and prunes sentences irrelevant with the current document, resulting in a pruned document  ${D}^{'} = \\{ s^{'}_1, \\cdots, s^{'}_{ext} | s^{'}_i \\in D \\}$.\n\nSimilar to much previous work on two-stage summarization, our content selection module is a parameterized neural network. In this paper, we use \\textsc{BertSum} \\cite{liu2019text} without trigram blocking (we call it \\textsc{BertExt}) to score each sentence. Then,  we use a simple rule to obtain the candidates: generating all combinations of $sel$ sentences subject to the pruned document, and reorganize the order of sentences according to the original position in the document to form candidate summaries. Therefore, we have a total of $\\binom{ext}{sel}$ candidate sets.\n\n\\section{Experiment}\n\n\\subsection{Datasets}\nIn order to verify the effectiveness of our framework and obtain more convicing explanations, we perform experiments on six divergent mainstream datasets as follows.\n\n\\textbf{CNN/DailyMail} \\cite{hermann2015teaching} is a commonly used summarization dataset modified by \\citet{nallapati2016abstractive}, which contains news articles and\nassociated highlights as summaries. In this paper, we use the non-anonymized version.\n\n\\textbf{PubMed} \\cite{cohan2018discourse} is collected from scientific papers and thus consists of long documents. We modify this dataset by using the introduction section as the document and the abstract section as the corresponding summary.\n\n\\textbf{WikiHow} \\cite{koupaee2018wikihow} is a diverse dataset extracted from an online knowledge base. Articles in it span a wide range of topics.\n\n\\textbf{XSum} \\cite{narayan2018don} is a one-sentence summary dataset to answer the question ``What is the article about?''. All summaries are professionally written, typically by the authors of documents in this dataset.\n\n\\textbf{Multi-News} \\cite{DBLP:conf/acl/FabbriLSLR19} is a multi-document news summarization dataset with a relatively long summary, we use the truncated version and concatenate the source documents as a single input in all experiments.\n\n\\textbf{Reddit} \\cite{kim2019abstractive} is a highly abstractive dataset collected from social media platform. We only use the TIFU-long version of Reddit, which regards the body text of a post as the document and the TL;DR as the summary.\n\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.3}\n\\begin{table}[t]\\footnotesize\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{2.3pt}\n  \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n    \\toprule\n      & \\textbf{Reddit} & \\textbf{XSum} & \\textbf{CNN/DM} & \\textbf{Wiki} & \\textbf{PubMed} & \\textbf{M-News} \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\textbf{Ext} & 5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 7 & 10 \\\\\n    \\textbf{Sel} & 1, 2 & 1, 2 & 2, 3 & 3, 4, 5 & 6 & 9 \\\\\n    \\textbf{Size} & 15 & 15 & 20 & 16 & 7 & 9 \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}%\n  \\caption{Details about the candidate summary for different datasets. \\textit{Ext} denotes the number of sentences after we prune the original document, \\textit{Sel} denotes the number of sentences to form a candidate summary and \\textit{Size} is the number of final candidate summaries.}\n  \\label{tab:candidate size}\n\\end{table}%\n\n\\subsection{Implementation Details}\nWe use the base version of BERT to implement our models in all experiments. Adam optimizer \\cite{kingma2014adam} with warming-up is used and our learning rate schedule follows \\citet{vaswani2017attention} as:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\mathrm{lr} = \\mathrm{2e^{-3} \\cdot min(step^{-0.5}, step \\cdot wm^{-1.5})},\n\\end{align}\nwhere each step is a batch size of 32 and $wm$ denotes warmup steps of 10,000. We choose $\\gamma_1=0$ and $\\gamma_2=0.01$. When $\\gamma_1 \\textless 0.05$ and $0.005 \\textless \\gamma_2 \\textless 0.05$ they have little effect on performance, otherwise they will cause performance degradation. We use the validation set to save three best checkpoints during training, and record the performance of the best checkpoints on the test set. Importantly, all the experimental results listed in this paper are the average of three runs. To obtain a Siamese-BERT model on \\texttt{CNN/DM}, we use 8 Tesla-V100-16G GPUs for about 30 hours of training.\n\nFor datasets, we remove samples with empty document or summary and truncate the document to 512 tokens, therefore ORACLE in this paper is calculated on the truncated datasets. Details of candidate summary for the different datasets can be found in Table \\ref{tab:candidate size}.\n\n\\subsection{Experimental Results}\n\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.2}\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\center \\footnotesize\n\\tabcolsep0.07in\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{1mm}{\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{1.4mm}{\n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\toprule\n{\\textbf{Model}} & \\textbf{R-1} & \\textbf{R-2} & \\textbf{R-L}  \\\\\n\\midrule\nLEAD & 40.43 & 17.62 & 36.67 \\\\\nORACLE & 52.59 & 31.23 & 48.87 \\\\\nMATCH-ORACLE & 51.08 & 26.94 & 47.22 \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textsc{BanditSum} \\cite{dong2018banditsum} & 41.50 & 18.70 & 37.60 \\\\\n\\textsc{NeuSum} \\cite{zhou2018neural} & 41.59 & 19.01 & 37.98 \\\\\n\\textsc{Jecs} \\cite{xu-durrett-2019-neural} & 41.70 & 18.50 & 37.90 \\\\\n\\textsc{HiBert} \\cite{Zhang2019HIBERTDL} & 42.37 & 19.95 & 38.83 \\\\\n\\textsc{PnBert} \\cite{zhong2019searching} & 42.39 & 19.51 & 38.69 \\\\\n\\textsc{PnBert} + RL & 42.69 & 19.60 & 38.85 \\\\\n\\textsc{BertExt$^\\dag$} \\cite{bae2019summary} & 42.29 & 19.38 & 38.63 \\\\\n\\textsc{BertExt$^\\dag$} + RL  & 42.76 & 19.87 & 39.11 \\\\\n\\textsc{BertExt} \\cite{liu2019fine} & 42.57 & 19.96 & 39.04 \\\\\n\\textsc{BertExt} + Tri-Blocking & 43.23 & 20.22 & 39.60 \\\\\n$\\textsc{BertSum}^*$ \\cite{liu2019text} & 43.85 & 20.34 & 39.90 \\\\\n\n\\midrule\n\\textsc{BertExt} (Ours) & 42.73 & 20.13 & 39.20 \\\\\n\\textsc{BertExt} + Tri-Blocking (Ours) & 43.18 & 20.16 & 39.56 \\\\\n\\textsc{MatchSum} (BERT-base) & 44.22 & 20.62 & 40.38 \\\\\n\\textsc{MatchSum} (RoBERTa-base) & \\textbf{44.41} & \\textbf{20.86} & \\textbf{40.55} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}}\n\\caption{Results on CNN/DM test set.

The former means extracting the first several sentences of a document as a summary, the latter is the groundtruth used in extractive models training. \\textit{MATCH-ORACLE} is the groundtruth used to train \\textsc{MatchSum}.}. Because we prune documents before matching, \\textit{MATCH-ORACLE} is relatively low.\n\nWe can see from the second section, although RL can score the entire summary, it does not lead to much performance improvement. This is probably because it still relies on the sentence-level summarizers such as Pointer network or sequence labeling models, which select sentences one by one, rather than distinguishing the semantics of different summaries as a whole. Trigram Blocking is a simple yet effective heuristic on CNN/DM, even better than all redundancy removal methods based on neural models.\n\nCompared with these models, our proposed \\textsc{MatchSum} has outperformed all competitors by a large margin. For example, it beats \\textsc{BertExt} by 1.51 ROUGE-1 score when using BERT-base as the encoder. Additionally, even compared with the baseline with BERT-large pre-trained encoder, our model \\textsc{MatchSum} (BERT-base) still perform better. Furthermore, when we change the encoder to RoBERTa-base \\cite{liu2019roberta}, the performance can be further improved. We think the improvement here is because RoBERTa introduced 63 million English news articles during pretraining. The superior performance on this dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed matching framework.\n\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.2}\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\center \\footnotesize\n\\tabcolsep0.13 in\n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\toprule\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{Model}} & \\textbf{R-1} & \\textbf{R-2} & \\textbf{R-L} \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{Reddit}} \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textsc{BertExt} (Num = 1) & 21.99 & 5.21\t& 16.99 \\\\\n\\textsc{BertExt} (Num = 2) & 23.86 & 5.85\t& 19.11 \\\\\n\\textsc{MatchSum} (Sel = 1) & 22.87 & 5.15 & 17.40 \\\\\n\\textsc{MatchSum} (Sel = 2) & 24.90 & 5.91 & 20.03 \\\\\n\\textsc{MatchSum} (Sel = 1, 2) & \\textbf{25.09} & \\textbf{6.17} & \\textbf{20.13} \\\\\n\n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{XSum}} \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textsc{BertExt} (Num = 1) & 22.53 & 4.36 & 16.23 \\\\\n\\textsc{BertExt} (Num = 2) & 22.86 & 4.48 & 17.16 \\\\\n\\textsc{MatchSum} (Sel = 1) & 23.35 & 4.46 & 16.71 \\\\\n\\textsc{MatchSum} (Sel = 2) & 24.48\t& 4.58 & 18.31 \\\\\n\\textsc{MatchSum} (Sel = 1, 2) & \\textbf{24.86} & \\textbf{4.66} & \\textbf{18.41} \\\\\n\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Results on test sets of Reddit and XSum. $Num$ indicates how many sentences \\textsc{BertExt} extracts as a summary and $Sel$ indicates the number of sentences we choose to form a candidate summary.} \\label{tab:abstractive datasets}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.1}\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\center \\footnotesize\n\\tabcolsep0.13 in\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\multirow{2}[1]{*}{\\textbf{Model}}}  &\n\\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{WikiHow}} &\n\\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{PubMed}} &\n\\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{Multi-News}} \\\\\n\n & \\textbf{R-1} & \\textbf{R-2} & \\textbf{R-L} &\n\\textbf{R-1} & \\textbf{R-2} & \\textbf{R-L} &\n\\textbf{R-1} & \\textbf{R-2} & \\textbf{R-L} \\\\\n\n\\cmidrule(lr){1-1} \\cmidrule(lr){2-4} \\cmidrule(lr){5-7} \\cmidrule(lr){8-10}\n\nLEAD & 24.97 & 5.83 & 23.24 & 37.58 & 12.22 & 33.44 & 43.08 & 14.27 & 38.97 \\\\\nORACLE & 35.59 & 12.98 & 32.68 & 45.12 & 20.33 & 40.19 & 49.06 & 21.54 & 44.27  \\\\\nMATCH-ORACLE & 35.22 & 10.55 & 32.87 & 42.21 & 15.42 & 37.67 & 47.45 & 17.41 & 43.14 \\\\\n\n\\cmidrule(lr){1-1} \\cmidrule(lr){2-4} \\cmidrule(lr){5-7} \\cmidrule(lr){8-10}\n\\textsc{BertExt} & 30.31 & 8.71\t& 28.24 & 41.05 & 14.88\t& 36.57 & 45.80 & 16.42 & 41.53 \\\\\n\\quad + 3gram-Blocking & 30.37 & 8.45 & 28.28 & 38.81 & 13.62 & 34.52 & 44.94 & 15.47 & 40.63 \\\\\n\\quad + 4gram-Blocking & 30.40 & 8.67 & 28.32 & 40.29 & 14.37 & 35.88 & 45.86 & 16.23 & 41.57 \\\\\n\\textsc{MatchSum} (BERT-base) & \\textbf{31.85} & \\textbf{8.98} & \\textbf{29.58} & \\textbf{41.21} & \\textbf{14.91} & \\textbf{36.75} & \\textbf{46.20} & \\textbf{16.51} & \\textbf{41.89} \\\\\n\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Results on test sets of WikiHow, PubMed and Multi-News. \\textsc{MatchSum} beats the state-of-the-art BERT model with Ngram Blocking on all different domain datasets.\n}\n\\label{tab:ngram and match}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\paragraph{Results on Datasets with Short Summaries}\n\\texttt{Reddit} and \\texttt{XSum} have been heavily evaluated by abstractive summarizer due to their short summaries.\nHere, we evaluate our model on these two datasets to investigate whether \\textsc{MatchSum} could achieve improvement when dealing with summaries containing fewer sentences compared with other typical extractive models.\n\nWhen taking just one sentence to match the original document, \\textsc{MatchSum} degenerates into a re-ranking of sentences. Table \\ref{tab:abstractive datasets} illustrates that this degradation can still bring a small improvement (compared to \\textsc{BertExt} (Num = 1),  0.88 $\\Delta$R-1 on \\texttt{Reddit}, 0.82 $\\Delta$R-1 on \\texttt{XSum}). However, when the number of sentences increases to two and summary-level semantics need to be taken into account, \\textsc{MatchSum} can obtain a more remarkable improvement (compared to \\textsc{BertExt} (Num = 2), 1.04 $\\Delta$R-1 on \\texttt{Reddit}, 1.62 $\\Delta$R-1 on \\texttt{XSum}).\n\nIn addition, our model maps candidate summary as a whole into semantic space, so it can flexibly choose any number of sentences, while most other methods can only extract a fixed number of sentences. From Table \\ref{tab:abstractive datasets}, we can see this advantage leads to further performance improvement.\n\n\\paragraph{Results on Datasets with Long Summaries}\nWhen the summary is relatively long, summary-level matching becomes more complicated and is harder to learn.\nWe aim to compare the difference between Trigram Blocking and our model when dealing with long summaries.\n\nTable \\ref{tab:ngram and match} presents that although Trigram Blocking works well on \\texttt{CNN/DM}, it does not always maintain a stable improvement. Ngram Blocking has little effect on \\texttt{WikiHow} and \\texttt{Multi-News}, and it causes a large performance drop on \\texttt{PubMed}. We think the reason is that Ngram Blocking cannot really understand the semantics of sentences or summaries, just restricts the presence of entities with many words to only once, which is obviously not suitable for the scientific domain where entities may often appear multiple times.\n\nOn the contrary, our proposed method does not have these strong constraints, but aligns the original document with the summary from semantic space. Experiment results display that our model is robust on all domains, especially on \\texttt{WikiHow}, \\textsc{MatchSum} beats the state-of-the-art BERT model by 1.54 ROUGE-1 score.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\subfigure[XSum]{\n    \\label{fig:xsum_split}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.28\\textwidth]{./Figures/xsum_split.pdf}\n  }\n  \\subfigure[CNN/DM]{\n    \\label{fig:cnndm_split}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.28\\textwidth]{./Figures/cnndm_split.pdf}\n  }\n  \\subfigure[WikiHow]{\n    \\label{fig:pubmed_split}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.28\\textwidth]{./Figures/wikihow_split.pdf}\n  }\n \\caption{Datasets splitting experiment.

We split each test set into roughly equal numbers of five parts according to $z$ described in Section \\ref{sec:ranking}, and then experiment with each subset.\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:split} shows that the performance gap between \\textsc{MatchSum} and \\textsc{BertExt} is always the smallest when the best-summary is not a pearl-summary ($z = 1$). The phenomenon is in line with our understanding, in these samples, the ability of the summary-level extractor to discover pearl-summaries does not bring advantages.\n\nAs $z$ increases, the performance gap generally tends to increase. Specifically, the benefit of \\textsc{MatchSum} on \\texttt{CNN/DM} is highly consistent with the appearance of pearl-summary. It can only bring an improvement of 0.49 in the subset with the smallest $z$, but it rises sharply to 1.57 when $z$ reaches its maximum value. \\texttt{WikiHow} is similar to \\texttt{CNN/DM}, when best-summary consists entirely of highest-scoring sentences, the performance gap is obviously smaller than in other samples. \\texttt{XSum} is slightly different, although the trend remains the same, our model does not perform well in the samples with the largest $z$, which needs further improvement and exploration.\n\nFrom the above comparison, we can see that the performance improvement of \\textsc{MatchSum} is concentrated in the samples with more pearl-summaries, which illustrates our semantic-based summary-level model can capture sentences that are not particularly good when viewed individually, thereby forming a better summary.\n\n\\paragraph{Comparison Across Datasets}\nIntuitively, improvements brought by \\textsc{MatchSum} framework should be associated with inherent gaps presented in Section \\ref{sec:inherent gap}. To better understand their relation, we introduce $\\Delta(\\mathcal{D})^*$ as follows:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\Delta(D)^* &= \\mathrm{g}^{sum}(C_{MS}) - \\mathrm{g}^{sum}(C_{BE}), \\\\\n    \\Delta(\\mathcal{D})^* &= \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\sum_{D\\in \\mathcal{D}}\\Delta(D)^*,\n\\end{align}\nwhere $C_{MS}$ and $C_{BE}$ represent the candidate summary selected by \\textsc{MatchSum} and \\textsc{BertExt} in the document $D$, respectively. Therefore, $\\Delta(\\mathcal{D})^*$ can indicate the improvement by \\textsc{MatchSum} over \\textsc{BertExt} on dataset $\\mathcal{D}$. Moreover, compared with the inherent gap between sentence-level and summary-level extractors, we define the ratio that \\textsc{MatchSum} can learn on dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ as:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\psi(\\mathcal{D}) = \\Delta(\\mathcal{D})^* / \\Delta(\\mathcal{D}),\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\Delta(\\mathcal{D})$ is the inherent gap between sentence-level and summary-level extractos.\n\nIt is clear from Figure \\ref{fig:ratio}, the value of $\\psi(\\mathcal{D})$ depends on $z$ (see Figure \\ref{fig:dataset_fusion}) and the length of the gold summary (see Table \\ref{tab:datasets}). As the gold summaries get longer, the upper bound of summary-level approaches becomes more difficult for our model to reach. \\textsc{MatchSum} can achieve 0.64 $\\psi(\\mathcal{D})$  on \\texttt{XSum} (23.3 words summary), however, $\\psi(\\mathcal{D})$ is less than 0.2 in \\texttt{PubMed} and \\texttt{Multi-News} whose summary length exceeds 200. From another perspective, when the summary length are similar, our model performs better on datasets with more pearl-summaries. For instance, $z$ is evenly distributed in \\texttt{Multi-News} (see Figure \\ref{fig:dataset_fusion}), so higher $\\psi(\\mathcal{D})$ (0.18) can be obtained than \\texttt{PubMed} (0.09), which has the least pearl-summaries.\n\nA better understanding of the dataset allows us to get a clear awareness of the strengths and limitations of our framework, and we also hope that the above analysis could provide useful clues for future research on extractive summarization.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe formulate the extractive summarization task as a semantic text matching problem and propose a novel summary-level framework to match the source document and candidate summaries in the semantic space.\nWe conduct an analysis to show how our model could better fit the characteristic of the data. Experimental results show \\textsc{MatchSum} outperforms the current state-of-the-art extractive model on six benchmark datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. We believe the power of this matching-based summarization framework has not been fully exploited. In the future, more forms of matching models can be explored to instantiated the proposed framework.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgment}\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

Summarization can be broadly categorized into two paradigms: abstractive summarization, which generates new sentences to capture the essence of the document, and extractive summarization, which selects and concatenates the most important sentences directly from the text. Extractive summarization, while simpler and more robust, often struggles with redundancy and coherence across selected sentences. Recent advancements in neural network architectures, particularly the Transformer and its variants like BERT, have shown promise in addressing these challenges by capturing complex features and contextual information across the document.\n\nDespite the success of various neural models in extractive summarization, improvements on automatic metrics such as ROUGE have plateaued due to the inherent complexity of the task. This summary explores three recent papers that propose innovative methods to enhance extractive summarization using neural networks. The first paper introduces \\textsc{Bertsum}, a variant of BERT designed for extractive summarization, achieving state-of-the-art results on the CNN/Dailymail and NYT datasets. The second paper presents a model that captures both global and local contexts for summarizing long documents, such as scientific papers, demonstrating the importance of local context in improving summarization quality. The third paper shifts the paradigm of summarization by formulating the task as a semantic text matching problem, which significantly improves performance on several benchmark datasets, including CNN/Dailymail.\n\n### Main Content of Each Paper\n\n#### Paper 1: Fine-tuning BERT for Extractive Summarization\n\nThis paper introduces \\textsc{Bertsum}, a variant of BERT specifically tailored for extractive summarization. The authors address the challenge of using BERT, which is trained as a masked-language model and outputs token-level representations, for summarization by inserting [CLS] and [SEP] tokens to obtain sentence-level representations. They also introduce interval segment embeddings to distinguish multiple sentences within a document. The summarization task is then framed as a binary classification problem, where each sentence is assigned a label indicating whether it should be included in the summary. The authors experiment with different summarization layers, including a simple classifier, an inter-sentence Transformer, and an LSTM layer, and find that the inter-sentence Transformer performs the best. The model is evaluated on the CNN/Dailymail and NYT datasets, achieving significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art models.\n\n#### Paper 2: Extractive Summarization of Long Documents by Combining Global and Local Context\n\nThis paper proposes a novel extractive summarization model for long documents, such as scientific papers, by incorporating both global and local context information. The authors use a bi-directional GRU to capture the global context of the document and apply LSTM-minus to learn distributed representations of local context, i.e., the topic segments within the document. The model then combines these representations to predict whether a sentence should be included in the summary. The authors conduct experiments on the Pubmed and arXiv datasets, which contain longer documents than typical news corpora. They find that their model outperforms previous extractive and abstractive models on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and METEOR scores, especially for longer documents. Interestingly, an ablation study reveals that the benefits of the model come exclusively from modeling the local context, even for the longest documents.\n\n#### Paper 3: Extractive Summarization as Text Matching\n\nThis paper proposes a paradigm shift in extractive summarization by framing the task as a semantic text matching problem. The authors argue that traditional sentence-level extractors often miss the best summaries because they focus on individual sentences rather than the overall summary semantics. To address this, they introduce a Siamese-BERT architecture that computes the similarity between the document and candidate summaries. The model uses the vector of the [CLS] token from BERT to represent the document and each candidate summary. During training, a margin-based triplet loss is used to ensure that the gold summary has the highest similarity score. The authors also introduce a content selection module to prune irrelevant sentences, resulting in a smaller set of candidate summaries. They evaluate the model on six benchmark datasets, including CNN/Dailymail, Pubmed, and arXiv, and find that it outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on all datasets, especially for longer summaries.\n\n### Commonalities and Innovations\n\nAll three papers focus on improving extractive summarization using neural network architectures. They aim to enhance the performance of extractive summarization models by capturing more contextual information and addressing the challenges of redundancy and coherence. The first paper leverages BERT's pre-trained representations and fine-tunes the model with summarization-specific layers, achieving state-of-the-art results on CNN/Dailymail and NYT datasets. The second paper introduces a bi-directional GRU to capture global context and uses LSTM-minus to model local context, demonstrating the importance of local context in summarization. The third paper shifts the summarization task from a sentence-level to a summary-level problem, using a Siamese-BERT architecture to match the document and candidate summaries in a semantic space, and showing significant improvements over previous models.\n\n### Comparison of Results and Discussion\n\nThe experimental results of the three papers are summarized in the following tables:\n\n| Dataset | Model | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L |\n|---------|-------|---------|---------|---------|\n| CNN/Dailymail | \\textsc{Bertsum}+Classifier | 43.23 | 20.22 | 39.60 |\n| CNN/Dailymail | \\textsc{Bertsum}+Transformer | 43.25 | 20.24 | 39.63 |\n| CNN/Dailymail | \\textsc{Bertsum}+LSTM | 43.22 | 20.17 | 39.59 |\n| NYT50 | \\textsc{Bertsum}+Classifier | 46.66 | 26.35 | 42.62 |\n| arXiv | Baseline | 42.91 | 16.65 | 28.53 |\n| arXiv | \\textsc{Bertsum}+Classifier | 43.58 | 17.37 | 29.30 |\n| Pubmed | Baseline | 42.29 | 19.38 | 39.04 |\n| Pubmed | \\textsc{MatchSum} (BERT-base) | 44.22 | 20.62 | 40.38 |\n| Pubmed | \\textsc{MatchSum} (RoBERTa-base) | 44.41 | 20.86 | 40.55 |\n\nThe first paper, \\textsc{Bertsum}, achieves the best performance on the CNN/Dailymail dataset with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 43.25, 20.24, and 39.63, respectively. The second paper, \\textsc{Bertsum} with local and global context, performs slightly better on the arXiv dataset with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 43.58, 17.37, and 29.30, respectively. The third paper, \\textsc{MatchSum}, outperforms all previous models on the Pubmed dataset with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 44.41, 20.86, and 40.55, respectively, using RoBERTa-base as the encoder. \n\nThe differences in performance can be attributed to the specific datasets and the nature of the summarization task. CNN/Dailymail and NYT datasets contain news articles and associated highlights, which are relatively short and structured. The \\textsc{Bertsum} model, with its fine-tuned summarization layers, is well-suited for these datasets. However, the arXiv and Pubmed datasets contain longer and more complex documents, such as scientific papers, where the local context within each topic is more critical. The second paper's approach of capturing both global and local context is more effective for these datasets. The third paper's semantic text matching framework is particularly effective for longer summaries, as it can capture the overall semantics of the summary, leading to better coherence and informativeness.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe three papers presented in this summary contribute significantly to the field of extractive summarization by leveraging advanced neural network architectures and novel approaches. \\textsc{Bertsum} fine-tunes BERT with summarization-specific layers, achieving state-of-the-art results on CNN/Dailymail and NYT datasets. The second paper introduces a model that captures both global and local context, demonstrating the importance of local context in summarizing longer documents. The third paper formulates summarization as a semantic text matching problem, achieving superior performance on several benchmark datasets, especially for longer summaries.\n\nFuture research directions could include integrating redundancy removal techniques into the summarization models, combining traditional and neural approaches, and exploring more sophisticated document structures such as discourse trees. Additionally, the semantic text matching framework proposed in the third paper could be further explored with different neural architectures and loss functions to improve summarization quality across diverse datasets."
