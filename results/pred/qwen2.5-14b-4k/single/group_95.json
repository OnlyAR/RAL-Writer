\nalthough they may be incomplete, there is no temporal alignment issue.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{img/align3.pdf}\n\t\\vspace*{-7mm}\n\t\\caption{\n\t\\footnotesize{An example of visual-textual mis-alignment in a raw instructional video.\n\tThe presenter's narration can be not visually relevant at all, \n\t{\\em e.g.}~describing a flavor;\n\tor asynchronous with visual content by a time difference.\n\tThe \\textcolor{googleblue}{\\textbf{\\cmark}} and \\textcolor{googleorange}{\\textbf{\\xmark}} \n\tindicate visually alignable and non-alignable text, respectively (by human judgement). \n\tThe colored bar shows the start-end timestamp of narration. \n\tExample from \\scriptsize{\\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8OGXmLTTiI?t=30}}.}}\n\\vspace{-14pt}\n\\label{fig:align}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe extent of these alignment challenges is significant~\\cite{Miech19,Miech20}.\nIn 10 hours of instructional videos~(sourced from HowTo100M) \nthat we annotated for this work, \nonly 30\\% of the narration sentences are visually alignable, \nand only {15\\%} are naturally well-aligned.\nThis means that \nthe demonstrator is describing their action \nsynchronously with the video only 15\\% of the time.\nIf the alignment issues are resolved then the benefits of learning \nfrom such narrated instruction videos can potentially be substantial: \nwith the extra time axis alignment, models can be trained to deal with fine-grained tasks, \nand predict temporal action localization and segmentation.\n\nIn this paper, we  tackle the sentence-to-video temporal alignment problem,\nand propose a Temporal Alignment Network~(TAN) that ingests a video sequence and its associated narrative sentences, \nattends to a large temporal context in both, and is able to: \n(1) determine if a sentence is alignable with the video; \nand (2) if it is alignable, then determine its temporal alignment.\nGiven all the challenges described above, training such a network on raw instructional videos, \n{\\em e.g.}, HowTo100M, is clearly a non-trivial task.\nTo this end, we propose a novel method for denoising, \nby co-training TAN with an auxiliary dual encoder network.\nBy design, these two networks use complementary architectures:\nTAN iteratively attends to temporal context from both visual and textual modalities,\nestablishing accurate alignment for sentences that are alignable;\nwhile the dual encoder processes visual and textual modalities independently, \nwhich enables it to spot unalignable sentences at ease, \n{\\em e.g.}, sentences that emit low alignment score to all frames within the video.\nThe output from these two networks can be treated as two different views for alignment,\nand their {\\em mutual agreements} are adopted for co-training.\n\nIn addition to introducing the model and training methodology, \nwe make the following contributions:\n(1) We manually annotate an 80-video subset of HowTo100M, named \\textbf{HTM-Align},\nby assigning the visually related sentences to their corresponding timestamps and annotating visually unrelated ones.  \nThis aligned subset is used to evaluate the model's performance \nand is released publicly;\n(2) We train the model on the HowTo100M dataset, \nand demonstrate a significant improvement in alignment over prior work (MIL-NCE approach of~\\cite{Miech20} in particular);\n(3) We apply the trained model in both the zero-shot and fine-tuned settings to multiple downstream video tasks and achieve state of the art results on both settings. \nThis includes text-video retrieval on YouCook2~\\cite{Zhou18} and \nweakly supervised video action segmentation on Breakfast-Action~\\cite{Kuehne12};\n(4) We use the automatically-aligned HowTo100M annotations to finetune\nthe \\emph{backbone model}, and observe improved performance \non downstream action classification tasks.\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\noindent \\textbf{Joint Visual-Textual Learning}\nhas a long history in computer vision.\nAs examples, early work from Mori et al.~\\cite{Mori99}\nexplored the connection between image and words in paired text documents, \nand~\\cite{Weston11} learnt a joint image-text embedding for the case of class name annotations.\nRecent works like CLIP~\\cite{Radford21} and ALIGN~\\cite{Jia21} show that \nlarge-scale paired image-caption data combined with a simple noise contrastive learning loss \nis able to learn a powerful visual representation.\nIn video domains, this is also true, as shown by MIL-NCE~\\cite{Miech20}, ALBEF~\\cite{Li21ALBF}, \nand VideoClip~\\cite{Xu2021videoclip}. \\\\[-8pt]\n\n\\par{\\noindent \\textbf{Visual-Textual Retrieval}}\nlearns a joint embedding space for both vision and language,\neither using a dual encoder~\\cite{Bain21,Gong14a,Gong14b,Klein15,Pan16,Plummer17,Dong19,Miech19,Radford21,Jia21}, \nwhere visual and textual inputs are independently encoded, \nor a joint encoder, \nconstructed with multimodal Transformers~\\cite{Tan19_lxmert,Lu19_Vilbert,Su19_Vlbert,Lu20_12in1,Chen20_Uniter,Li20_Unicoder,Zhou20}, \nwhere vision and text inputs are fed into the cross-modal attention to compute the similarity. \nDespite being more accurate, the incurred computation of the joint encoder limits its use for large-scale retrieval systems.\nIn~\\cite{Miech21}, \nthe authors propose to speed up the process by only using the joint encoder for re-ranking.\nIn this work, we also use both joint and dual encoders, \nbut for a different purpose -- to exploit their complementary information for co-training.\\\\[-8pt]\n\n\\par{\\noindent \\textbf{Visual-Textual Alignment}}\naims to temporally assign words or sentences to the corresponding\nvideo segments.  A similar task is weakly-supervised action\nsegmentation that tries to delineate the video segments corresponding\nto a given action\nlist~\\cite{Bojanowski14,Bojanowski15,Kuehne17,Ding18,Huang16,Richard18,Chang19,Zhukov2019,Li19cdfl,Zhang21tqn}.\nIn transcript\nalignment~\\cite{Sankar06,Cour08,Sankar09,Zhu15,Tapaswi15}, where\ninstead of an action list, scripts describing a series of events in\nthe video are given, the goal is to assign each of the script texts to\nthe appropriate segment~(shot) of the video.  More closely related to\nour goal are methods that seek a global alignment between sequences\nwith soft Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)~\\cite{Cuturi17}. The recent\nDrop-DTW~\\cite{Dvornik21} proposes to handle outliers in the sequences\nby allowing the alignment process to automatically skip certain\nsteps. This is similar to our aim of identifiying non-alignable\nsentences. However, since in HowTo100M the order of the alignable sentences \ndoes not follow the original order of \nthe subtitles, this rules out the use of DTW-type approaches.\\\\[-8pt]\n\n\\par{\\noindent \\textbf{Co-training and Self-training}}\nare common techniques for unsupervised and weakly supervised learning.\nCo-training~\\cite{Blum98} builds two models \nto learn the different views of the data, \nwhile using one to expand the training set for the other.\nIt has recently been used for representation learning~\\cite{Tian20,Han20coclr}.\nSelf-training refers to the process of training on \npseudo-labels generated from a model's own predictions.\nIt has been used for image classification~\\cite{Caron18,Xie20_student,Caron20,Asano20}, \nobject detection~\\cite{Cinbis15}, and machine translation~\\cite{He20}. \nOur work is related to this line of research, \nwhere the TAN and the auxiliary network self-correct the noisy annotations, \nsuch that both networks can gradually improve their performance by training on cleaner data. \\\\[-8pt]\n\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\par{\\noindent \\textbf{Supervised Action Segmentation \\& Detection}}\nhave been extensively studied on numerous video

segmentation, the goal is to densely classify each time point of the video into one of the pre-defined action

Sec~\\ref{subsec:problem_scenario}, \nfollowed by the architecture for our proposed alignment network in Sec~\\ref{subsec:tan}. \nIn Sec~\\ref{subsec:training}, we describe a na\\\"ive training procedure on raw instructional video,\nwith the text-video correspondence provided by YouTube ASR, despite the considerable noise.\nIn Sec~\\ref{subsec:cotraining}, \nwe present the co-training method, \nthat exploits the {\\em mutual agreement} between the alignment network \nand an auxiliary dual encoder,\nand is able to simultaneously denoise and learn \nfrom the noisy narrated instructional videos.\n\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\subsection{Problem Scenario}\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\label{subsec:problem_scenario}\nGiven an untrimmed instructional video $\\mathcal{X} = \\{\\mathcal{I}, \\mathcal{S}\\}$, \nwhere $\\mathcal{I} = \\{I_1, I_2, \\dots, I_T\\}$ refers to the corresponding video with $T$ frames, \nand $\\mathcal{S} = \\{S_1, \\dots, S_K\\}$ \ndenotes the $K$ given sentences~(ordered by time). \nFor each sentence, we also have their timestamps obtained from YouTube ASR \n({\\em e.g.} $[t_k^{\\text{start}}, t_k^{\\text{end}}]$ for the $k$-th sentence).\nIn this paper, our goal is to train a temporal alignment network on a video dataset of instructional videos,\nwhich takes the videos and sentences as inputs, and outputs a textual-visual similarity matrix~($\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}$),\nas well as an alignability score for each sentence:\n\\vspace{-3mm}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\{ \\hat{y}, \\hat{\\mathbb{A}} \\} = \\Phi(\\mathcal{X}; \\Theta),\\quad \\hat{\\mathbb{A}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times T}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\hat{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times 2}$ refers to binary scores for all sentences, \nindicating whether the sentence is alignable.\n$\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}$ denotes the similarity matrix between frames and the given sentences, \nwhere for any alignable sentence it should emit a higher score with its corresponding video timestamps than others,\nand $\\Theta$ are the parameters of the model.\n\n\\vspace{1mm}\n\\subsection{Temporal Alignment Network~(TAN)}\n\\label{subsec:tan}\nAs shown in Figure~\\ref{main_fig}~(left), \nthe alignment network takes a video sequence and its associated narration / text sentences as input,\nand attends to the long temporal contexts in both, in order to:\n(i) determine if a sentence is alignable with the video~($\\hat{y}$), and\n(ii) output the alignment matrix~($\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}$).\nNext, we describe the alignment network, consisting of a visual-textual backbone, \nMultimodal Transformer, and alignability prediction module.\\\\[-6pt]\n\n\\noindent \\textbf{Visual-Textual Backbone. }\nGiven a long instructional video ({\\em e.g.} 64s) with its associated sentences,\nwe first extract the visual and textual features with pre-trained networks.\nSpecifically, based on MIL-NCE~\\cite{Miech20},\nwe use their pre-trained S3D-G backbone to extract video features,\nand a 2-layer MLP with the word2vec embeddings~\\cite{Mikolov13a} to extract sentence features.\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\begin{align}\n    v = f(\\mathcal{I}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T\\times C}\\quad\\quad\n    s = g(\\mathcal{S}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K\\times C}\n\\end{align}\n$v, s$ refer to the computed video and text features respectively,\nand each is of dimension $C$, in general, $T \\gg K$.\\\\[-6pt]\n\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\noindent {\\bf Multimodal Transformer.}\nThis module jointly processes the visual-textual features~($v, s$) with a multi-layer Transformer Encoder, \nwhich iteratively attends to both modalities to establish the text-to-video correspondence:\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\begin{align}\n    [\\hat{v}; \\hat{s}] = \\Phi_{\\textsc{MT}}([v+\\textsc{TE}; s])\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\Phi_{\\textsc{MT}}$ refers to the Multimodal Transformer Encoder,\n\\textsc{TE} denotes the learnable temporal embedding,\n$\\hat{v}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{T\\times C}$ and $\\hat{s}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times C}$ are \nthe output visual and textual embeddings from the Multimodal Transformer, and the\n``$[;]$'' symbol denotes concatenation.\nThe alignment matrix $\\hat{\\mathbb{A}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times T}$ is computed via cosine similarity:\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\hat{\\mathbb{A}}_{[i,j]} = \\frac{\\hat{s}_i \\cdot \\hat{v}_j}{\\|\\hat{s}_i\\| \\|\\hat{v}_j\\|} \n\\end{align}\n\n\\noindent {\\bf Alignability Prediction Module. }\nApart from estimating the alignment matrix, \nanother main functionality of the alignment network is to infer whether a particular sentence is alignable or not. \nThis is achieved by training a single linear layer~($\\phi(\\cdot)$) on the textual features, as shown in Figure~\\ref{main_fig}~(left):\n\\vspace{-6pt}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\hat{y} = \\phi_{\\text{align}}(\\hat{s})\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\hat{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times 2}$ refers to the binary predictions for all sentences, \ndeciding if the sentence is alignable or not.\n\n\\subsection{Training}\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\label{subsec:training}\nIn this section, \nwe describe a na\\\"ive training procedure for the alignment network with contrastive learning, \non the  instructional videos with YouTube ASR timestamps.\nNote that, at this stage, all the sentences have their corresponding video timestamps, and are treated as alignable. \nHence, the alignability prediction module can not be trained here. \\\\[-6pt]\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\noindent {\\bf Temporal Correspondence. }\nFor a video with $K$ sentences,\nwe directly convert its YouTube ASR results into 1D binary masks,\nwith 1's at the timestamps where the sentence is being spoken by the demonstrator, {\\em i.e.}, $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{ m_1, \\dots,  m_K\\}$, \nwhere $m_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times T }$.\nThe objective is therefore to jointly optimize the visual-textual embedding, \nsuch that the similarity score between the sentence and its corresponding visual frames is maximised. \nThe training objective is constructed as:\n\n\\vspace{-4mm}\n{\\footnotesize\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\textsc{TC}} = \n- \\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\log{\n    \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{P}_k}{\\exp{(\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}_{[k,i]} / \\tau)}}}\n         {{\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{P}_k} {\\exp{(\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}_{[k,i]} / \\tau)}}} + \n         {\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_k} {\\exp{(\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}_{[k,j]} / \\tau)}}}}\n         }\n\\label{eq:tc_loss}\n\\end{align}}\n\\vspace{-4.0mm}\n\n\\noindent where $\\mathcal{P}_k \\in \\{m_k = 1\\}$, \n$\\mathcal{N}_k \\in \\{m_k = 0\\}$ refer to the sets \nconsisting of positive and negative pairs, respectively. \n$\\mathcal{L}_{\\textsc{TC}}$ resembles a variant of the InfoNCE loss~\\cite{Oord18}.\\\\[-8pt]\n\n\\noindent {\\bf Discussion}. \nGiven the groundtruth annotation for alignment,\noptimizing $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textsc{TC}}$ would be trivial.\nHowever, on raw instructional videos \nwhere the provided YouTube ASR timestamps are highly unreliable \nwith an extremely high noise ratio,\nna\\\"ively optimising $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textsc{TC}}$ leads to sub-optimal results, as will be demonstrated in Section~\\ref{subsec:ablation}.\n\nIn general, the noise sources from the raw instructional videos \ncan be mainly categorised into three types, as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:align}:\n\\emph{First}, \nthe majority of the given sentences are actually not correlated to the video content (unalignable),\n{\\em e.g.}~greeting, chatting;\n\\emph{Second}, there is an alignment offset, \nin that the temporal interval of the spoken sentence rarely aligns with the video segments it refers to;\n\\emph{Third}, the demonstrator  often makes statements that do not follow the same order as their action, \nwhich rules out the use of DTW-type approaches.\n\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\subsection{Co-Training}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\label{subsec:cotraining}\nIn this section, \nwe propose a novel {\\em co-training} method to both denoise the instructional videos and train the alignment network.\nSpecifically, we introduce a dual encoder~(Section~\\ref{subsubsec:dual_enc}), \nwhich can be seen as a collaborator to the alignment network. \nThis procedure is detailed below.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\t\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{img/loss_agree.pdf}\n\t\\vspace*{-8mm}\n\t\\caption{\\footnotesize{\n    Illustration of denoising by mutual agreement.\n    The video sample is the same as in Figure~\\ref{fig:align}.\n\t\\textbf{(a)}: The alignment matrix $\\mathbb{A}$ from the TAN after Stage-1 training.\n\t\\textbf{(b)}: The alignment matrix $\\mathbb{A}_d$ from the dual encoder\n\tafter Stage-1 training.\n\t\\textbf{(c)}: The most alignable timestamps are inferred from both alignment matrices.\n\t\\textbf{(d)}: By filtering the

model dynamically chooses aligned temporal segments to train,\n\tand ignores non-alignable ones.\n\tFor this example, the self-labelling process corrects the timestamps of the 1st and 3rd sentences, \n\tand marks the rest of the sentences as non-alignable.\n\tIt roughly matches the human judgement of the alignment\n\tas shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:align}.\n\tThe alignment matrix values shown here are computed from the trained model-A in Table~\\ref{table:ablation_loss}.}}\n\t\\vspace{-6mm}.\n\t\\label{fig:loss}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\vspace{-4mm}\n\\subsubsection{Dual Encoder}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\label{subsubsec:dual_enc}\nAs shown in Figure~\\ref{main_fig}~(right),\nthe dual encoder independently processes the visual features with a Transformer Encoder~\\cite{Vaswani17}.\nIt is designed to be complementary to the alignment network:\nfor example, the dual encoder is fast and lightweight, \nwhich enables training on a large number of visual-text pairs,\nhowever, it only allows both modalities to communicate at the end, \nhence is unable to capture the textual contexts, \nand it is more sensitive to detect unaligned texts;\nwhile the proposed TAN, consisting of a Multimodal Transformer,\nalways has access to both modalities, and can learn to establish visual-textual correspondence within the network. \nDespite being beneficial for the temporal alignment task,\nthe TAN  is slow and computationally demanding, limiting its ability for contrasting with large-scale and diverse negative visual-textual pairs. \nFormally, for the dual encoder, we have: \n\\vspace{-3mm}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\hat{v}^{d} = \\Phi_{\\textsc{d}}(v + \\textsc{TE}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T\\times C}\n\\end{align}\n\\vspace{-4mm}\n\n\\noindent where $\\Phi_{\\textsc{d}}$ refers to the Video Transformer, \nand $\\textsc{TE}$ is the learnable temporal embedding for supplying the temporal ordering.\nA textual-visual cosine similarity matrix $\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}_d\\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times T}$ \nfrom the dual encoder is computed as:\n\\vspace{-3mm}\n\\begin{align}\n    {\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}}_{d [i,j]}  = \\frac{s_i \\cdot \\hat{v}^{d}_{j}}{\\|s_i\\| \\|\\hat{v}^{d}_{j}\\|}\n\\end{align}\n\\vspace{-9mm}\n\n\\subsubsection{Denoising by Mutual Agreement}\\label{subsubsec:denoising}\n\\vspace{-1mm}\nTo denoise the YouTube ASR annotations,\nwe generate pseudo-labels (both the alignability and the timestamps) \nby verifying the \\textit{mutual agreement} between the output alignment matrices \nfrom the alignment network and dual encoder, {\\em i.e.}~$\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}_d$.\nThe verification process is executed in three steps: \\\\[-4pt]\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\noindent \\textbf{(a) Infer Timestamps. }\nDuring training, for each sentence,\nwe use the two output alignment matrices $\\hat{\\mathbb{A}},\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}_d \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times T}$ (Figure~\\ref{fig:loss}-a,b) to infer the most plausible aligned timestamps.\nTo avoid outlier points, for the $k$-th sentence, \nwe scan its corresponding similarity row by averaging the scores within a temporal window, \nthis window is of the same size as its original YouTube timestamp label, {\\em i.e}~sentence by the demonstrator.\n\nAfterwards, \nwe pick the most confident prediction by taking the $\\argmax$.\nNote that, \nsuch operation ends up with a single temporal window\nwith the same duration as the YouTube timestamp.\nThat is to say, \nwe only shift the temporal position of the original YouTube label to its most confident prediction.\nAt this step, for the $k$-th sentence, \nwe obtain two `shifted' timestamps $\\hat{m}_k$ and $\\hat{m}^d_k$,\none from the alignment network, \nthe other from the dual encoder respectively, \nas shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:loss}-c.  \\\\[-4pt]\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\noindent \\textbf{(b) Alignment overlap using IoU. }\nGiven the inferred timestamps for sentence $k$,\nwe compute an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) score to measure \nthe agreement between the shifted timestamps: \n\\vspace{-4mm}\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{IoU-score}_k = \\frac\n{\\hat{m}_{k} \\cap \\hat{m}^d_{k}}\n{\\hat{m}_{k} \\cup \\hat{m}^d_{k}}\n\\end{align}\n\\vspace{-5mm}\n\n\\noindent \nA high IoU score indicates the sentence is very likely to be \naligned with the inferred timestamps.\nFor a batch, we filter the sentences with a positive IoU score,\nand update their timestamps by the union of their inferred timestamps $\\hat{m}_{k} \\cup \\hat{m}^d_{k}$. \nEmpirically, we find this operation roughly updates the timestamps for about 30\\% of the sentences.\nFor the sentences with zero IoU score, \nwe keep their YouTube timestamps unchanged.\nSuch an operation ends up with a set of updated timestamps \n$\\{\\hat{m}'_1, \\dots, \\hat{m}'_K\\}$ for all sentences.\n\nIn addition, to reflect each sentence's alignability, \nwe can compute an average cosine similarity score falling into the new temporal segment. Formally, for the $k$-th sentence,\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\begin{align}\n\\epsilon_k = \\frac{1}{\\sum{\\hat{m}'_k}}\n                       \\sum{\\hat{m}'_k\\cdot (\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}+\\hat{\\mathbb{A}}_d)_{[k,:]}} \n\\end{align}\n\\vspace{-4mm}\n\n\\noindent where $\\epsilon_k$ refers to the alignment score.\nTo put it simply, if a sentence has positive IoU-score,\nwe compute its align-score within the union of inferred timestamps;\nif it has zero IoU-score, we compute its align-score within its original YouTube timestamps.\\\\[-4pt]\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\noindent \\textbf{(c) Filter Alignability. }\nTo filter the alignability scores,\n{\\em i.e.}, $\\{\\epsilon_1, \\dots, \\epsilon_K\\}$,\nwe introduce a hyper-parameter $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$,\nwithin a sample batch, we treat the sentences with the top $100\\alpha\\%$ of align-score as positive, \nand the bottom $100(1-\\alpha)$\\% sentences as negative.\nThis gives binary pseudo-labels for alignability, denoted as $y_{\\text{pseudo}}$.\nThe alignability prediction module can thus be trained for binary classification\nwith a cross-entropy loss~(as shown in Figure~\\ref{main_fig}), \n{\\em i.e.}, $\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{\\text{Alignability}} = \\text{CE}(\\hat{y}, y_{\\text{pseudo}})$.\n\nIntuitively, this is to say, \na sentence is treated as being alignable \nif both the alignment network and the dual encoder agree the sentence \nhas a high similarity with its corresponding time stamps.\nAlso the $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{TC}$ (Equation~\\ref{eq:tc_loss})\nis only trained for the top $100\\alpha\\%$ of the sentences. \nIn our experiments, we sweep $\\alpha\\in\\{0.25, 0.5, 0.75\\}$.\n\n\\vspace{-10pt}\n\\subsubsection{Training Cycle}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\nTo summarize, the training can be divided into two stages. At the first stage~({S1: Initialization}), \nboth the alignment network and dual encoder are trained with ${\\mathcal{L}}_{\\text{TC}}$ using the given YouTube timestamps as labels.\nOnce warmed up, \nthe new pseudo-labels will be generated from the mutual agreement \nbetween alignment network and dual encoder \\emph{on the fly}, \nand starts the second stage training~({S2: Co-Training}),\nwith $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}} = \\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{\\text{TC}} +\n\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{\\text{Alignability}}$.\nNote that it is not necessary to iterate S1 and S2,\nbecause in S2 the quality of pseudo-labels can be improved \nalong the training with an EMA mechanism (introduced next).\nBy default in our experiments,\nwe train S1 for 50k iterations, \nand train S2 for another 50k iterations.\nIt accounts for 8 epochs on HTM-370K per stage. \n\n\\vspace{-12pt}\n\\subsubsection{ \\noindent \\textbf{Self-labelling with EMA }}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\nNa\\\"ively using the {\\em mutual agreement}\nbetween the alignment network and dual encoder\nfor co-training can lead to trivial solutions,\nwhere the alignment network and the dual encoder learn to ``collaborate'' with each other\nand assign high similarity scores to certain fixed timestamps.\nWe avoid this `collapse problem'  by keeping an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the model \nsimilar to BYOL~\\cite{Grill2020byol}.\nThe EMA branch is only slowly updated and used to generate the agreements for denoising \nas introduced in Section~\\ref{subsubsec:denoising}. \nThe main branch is trained with the updated timestamps and alignability.\nWe use the same momentum coefficient as that from BYOL in our experiments ($0.99$).\nBy default, all evaluations use the main branch. % !TEX root =

we first describe the data preparation process,\nand present the annotated visual-textual aligned subset of HowTo100M~(named \\textbf{HTM-Align}) for evaluation.\nThen we describe the implementation details and ablation studies for the alignment task. \n\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\subsection{Data Preparation}\n\\vspace{-1mm}\nHowTo100M is a large-scale instructional video dataset crawled from YouTube,\nconsisting of around $1.2$M videos and their generated text transcripts from speech~(ASR).\nThe start-end timestamps of each sentence are provided by ASR, \nbut they are often {\\em not semantically aligned} with the visual scene~(Figure~\\ref{fig:align}). \n\n\\vspace{-.4cm}\n\\subsubsection{HTM-370K~(Training)} \n\\vspace{-2mm}\nWe mostly use a subset of the original HowTo100M for training,\nwith 370K videos from the `Food \\& Entertaining' categories,\nconsisting of 32\\% of the videos of the entire HowTo100M dataset.\nApart from the mis-alignment issue, we also find three other issues in the subtitles:\nincorrect language translation, duplicated text, and incomplete sentence fractions.\nAs dataset pre-processing, \nwe conduct an automatic curation with open-sourced BERT-based model.\nThe full details of automatic curation can be found in the~\\app.\n\nAfter automatically processing and filtering out low-quality subtitles, \nwe end up with a subset of 370K instructional videos, thus the name \\textbf{HTM-370K}.\nNote that all the cleaning steps are automatic, using models trained with self-supervised learning.\nWe attribute the pre-processing of HowTo100M as a small contribution,\nand we will make all cleaned video IDs and subtitles publicly available.\n\n\\vspace{-7pt}\n\\subsubsection{HTM-Align~(Evaluation)} \n\\vspace{-2mm}\nWe randomly pick 80 videos from the HTM-370K as a hold-out testing set for evaluation purpose.\nThese videos range from $2$ to $16$ minutes, totalling 10 hours.\nWe manually label the alignability for each sentence, \n{\\em i.e.}~binary annotation.\nFor those alignable ones, \nwe further align them to the video segments with start-end timestamps.\nIn total, \n49K sentences are manually examined, with 13K of them being manually aligned.\nOn average each video contains 61 sentences, and 17 of them are visually aligned.\n\nUnlike the existing YouCook2 benchmark, \nwhere annotators only rephrase fixed recipe steps as the action description,\n\\textbf{HTM-Align} includes random instructional videos without a fixed recipe,\nand are adopted from the demonstrators' narration with minor modification,\nhence containing large diversity on both videos and texts.\nThe details of the annotation and examples can be found in the \\app. \n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\subsection{Implementation Details}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\label{sec:imp}\nDuring training, \nwe adopt a pre-trained S3D~(released by~\\cite{Miech20}) as the video encoder.\nSpecifically, \nthe S3D network outputs a single feature vector~(1024D) for every 16 frames, \nwhen the videos are decoded with 16fps, \nthis accounts for 1 feature per second without temporal overlap.\nFor the text encoder, we use Bag-of-word~(BoW) based on Word2Vec embeddings.\nBy default, in each video we randomly sample a temporal window of 64 seconds \n(which is 64 continuous visual features, we also tried 32s and 128s in ablation study), \nand the corresponding subtitles within this window.\nWe train the model with AdamW optimizer and $10^{-4}$ learning rate, \nwith a batch size of 64 videos.\nFull implementation details are in the~\\app. \\\\[-8pt]\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\\textbf{CrossTask}~\\cite{Zhukov2019} \nincludes 18 tasks and 2.7k instructional videos with manually annotated action segments. \nEach video may contain multiple segments, corresponding to different actions. \nIt also provides an ordered list of action steps with short natural language descriptions for each task. \nWe apply our model trained only on HowTo100M to the problem of step localization by computing similarity between every short clip in the video and the action label names of CrossTask. \nWe use the same recall metric as in~\\cite{Zhukov2019}, \nwhich is defined by the number of step assignments that fall into the correct ground truth interval, \ndivided by the total number of steps in the video. \nVideos from the test set of CrossTask are removed from the HowTo100M training set to ensure \nthat they are not observed at training time.\n\\end{comment}\n\n\\begin{comment}\nWe manually annotate a small subset of HowTo100M videos for testing. \nAnnotators are given the video and the corresponding subtitles with start and end timestamps, and annotate if each subtitle is align-able with the video (True/False) and modify the subtitle time stamps to cover the corresponding video segment.\nWe quantitatively and qualitatively show our performance on xxx. \n\\end{comment}\n\n\\begin{comment}\nWe conduct the ablation study on zero-shot text-video retrieval on YouCook2, as shown in Table~\\ref{table:ablation_retrieval}.\nNote that the A4 setting is the clip-wise text-video retrieval performance of MIL-NCE~\\cite{Miech20} \nsince we extract their base feature as the starting point, the result was also reproduced in~\\cite{yc2_leaderboard}. \nA1 and A2 are both continued from A3 with and without de-noising module for another 10 epochs,\nthe difference shows the effectiveness of de-noising operation (17.7 vs 16.4 for R@1).\nComparing A3 with A4 shows the effectiveness of the transformer module which takes temporal context into account. \n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\begin{tabu}{l|l|llll}\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\# & Settings \\textcolor{myblue}{(HTM epochs)}    & R@1$\\uparrow$  & R@5$\\uparrow$  &

temporal visual-textual alignment task on the \\textbf{HTM-Align} dataset.\nIn detail, during inference, \ngiven the video with a sequence of sentences by the demonstrator,\nwe take the alignment matrix from our alignment network, $\\hat{\\mathbb{A}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times T}$,\nwith $K, T$ indicating the number of sentences and video timestamps respectively.\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\subsection{Metrics}\n\\vspace{-1mm}\nWe measure two metrics for the alignment task, Recall@1 and ROC-AUC value.\nThe \\textbf{Recall@1} metric is a `pointing game' as introduced in~\\cite{Zhukov2019}.\nSpecifically, for a considered sentence, \nif its maximally matched video timestamp falls into the groundtruth segment,\nit is counted as being successfully recalled. \nThe recall scores are then averaged across all the text segments.\nThe alignability prediction is a binary classification problem as introduced in section~\\ref{subsec:problem_scenario},\nwe use ROC curve and report the \\textbf{Area-Under-the-Curve} value (ROC-AUC).\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\subsection{Ablation Study}\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\label{subsec:ablation}\nIn this section, we investigate the effects of multiple design choices and discuss the results.\\\\[-8pt]\n\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\noindent {\\bf Comparing with baseline.}\nIn Table~\\ref{table:ablation_loss}, \nthe first two rows are the baselines from CLIP~(ViT-B/32)~\\cite{Radford21} and MIL-NCE~\\cite{Miech20}.\nSpecifically, we compute the alignment similarity matrix using their textual and visual encoders, \nnormalize the score following their pretrained paradigms, and compute the R@1 on top of the alignment matrix. \nNote that for ROC-AUC, since CLIP and MIL-NCE do not have a specific binary classifier,\nfor each text, we directly use its maximum similarity score (across the time axis) as an indicator of alignability.\nFirst, CLIP~\\cite{Radford21} is performing significantly worse than others on this alignment task.\nA possible reason is that CLIP has only been trained on images, thus lacks video dynamics.\nMIL-NCE is a strong baseline which has short-term temporal modelling (up to 3.2s) \nand was trained end-to-end on HowTo100M.\nIn our model-A, we take the pre-extracted visual and textual feature from MIL-NCE,\nand train the transformers on the HTM-370K dataset\nto learn a longer temporal context ({\\em e.g.} 64s) for the alignment task.\nOur result (model-A 45.8 R@1 vs MIL-NCE 31.3 R@1) shows that longer temporal context is useful for this alignment task. \\\\[-8pt]\n\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\noindent {\\bf Effect of Transformer Depth.}\nFor both the alignment network and dual encoder, we use 6-layer transformers by default, \nas a balance between performance and training cost.\nIn model-B we also tried using 3-layer transformer and found it performs worse than 6-layer transformer (model-B vs A).\nUsing more than 6 layers takes more memory and sacrifices batch size. \\\\[-9pt]\n\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\noindent {\\bf Effect of Co-Training.}\nIn the model-\\{D,E\\}, we apply the Stage-2 training (co-training) based on the model-A.\nWe observe that co-training brings a clear performance gain for the alignment task (model-\\{D,E\\} vs.~model-A,\n3-4\\% boost on R@1), confirming the effectiveness of the denoising procedure.\nNote that model-C does not perform well due to the choice of alignability threshold $\\alpha$, explained next.\n\\\\[-9pt]\n\n\\vspace{-4mm}\n\\noindent {\\bf Effect of Alignability Thresholds.}\nFor the choice of alignability threshold $\\alpha$ (as introduced in Section~\\ref{subsec:cotraining}),\nwhich reflects a balance of data noise and diversity in the co-training procedure,\nour model-\\{C,D,E\\} show $\\alpha=0.5$ and $\\alpha=0.75$ work similarly well for alignment metrics and \n$\\alpha=0.5$ is slightly better for the R@1 metric.\nHowever $\\alpha=0.25$ leads to much worse performance.\nWe conjecture that a low value of $\\alpha$ limits the diversity while training $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{TC}}$ \n({\\em i.e.}~$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{TC}}$ learns from only 25\\% of the sentences).\\\\[-9pt]\n\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\noindent {\\bf Effect of Training Data.}\nIn model-H, we train the co-training stage on the automatically curated HTM-Full dataset, \nwhich includes all other non-cooking categories from HowTo100M comparing with HTM-370K. \nComparing model-H with D on the alignment task,\n adding out-of-domain videos does not harm the alignment performance on our curated subset. \\\\[-9pt]\n\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\noindent {\\bf Effect of Input Video Length.}\nIn Table~\\ref{table:ablation_loss}, \nwe vary the length of the input video to show if our alignment network benefits from the longer video context.\nIndeed, the alignment network gets better performance when increasing the input video length from 32 to 64 seconds~(model-D vs model-F). \nWe conjecture that sampling longer input video introduces more \\emph{alignable} sentences, \nhelps to reduce the temporal ambiguity for other sentences.\nHowever, further increasing the input video length to 128 seconds \ngives a similar alignment performance~(model-G vs model-D),\nwe conjecture this is due the reduced batch size in training,\nand the far-away visual context~({\\em i.e.}\\ 2 minutes or further) is less relevant for aligning the sentence.\n\n\\begin{table*}[!htb]\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\footnotesize\n\\hspace{-6pt}\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{c|c|lll}\n    \\hline\n    Method   & Trained on BF

(\\textbf{F-Acc}),\nsegment-wise Intersection-over-Union (\\textbf{IoU}) and Intersection-over-Detection (\\textbf{IoD}).\nPlease refer to ~\\app~for more details.\n\nWe evaluate our method with both the zero-shot and finetune settings.\nIn the former case, \nour alignment network was \\emph{only} trained on HTM-370K, \nand directly evaluated on Breakfast;\nwhile in the latter, \nwe finetune our alignment network on Breakfast with a soft-DTW loss~\\cite{Cuturi17} stacked on top of the output alignment matrix for 50 epochs. \nDuring inference, the alignment network takes as input a single video and the given list of action labels, ~\\ie `crack egg', `fry egg', \\emph{etc},\nand outputs the alignment matrix $\\mathbb{A}$, \nwhich is passed through a DTW, ending up with the action boundaries.\n\nAs shown in Table~\\ref{table:align}, \nin the zero-shot setting, \nour proposed alignment network surpasses the strong baseline~(MIL-NCE) by a large margin on all metrics~($>3\\%$), and even achieves comparable results to those supervised approaches.\nAfter finetuning, we see a further performance boost, \nobtaining state-of-the-art results.

For long videos, given a paragraph of description where the sentences describe different segments of the video, by matching all sentence-clip pairs,  the paragraph and the full video are aligned implicitly. However, such unit-level comparison may ignore global temporal context, which inevitably limits the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning framework TempCLR to compare the full video and the paragraph explicitly. As the video/paragraph is formulated as a sequence of clips/sentences, under the constraint of their temporal order, we use dynamic time warping to compute the minimum cumulative cost over sentence-clip pairs as the sequence-level distance. To explore the temporal dynamics, we break the consistency of temporal succession by shuffling video clips w.r.t. temporal granularity. Then, we obtain the representations for clips/sentences, which perceive the temporal information and thus facilitate the sequence alignment. In addition to pre-training on the video and paragraph, our approach can also generalize on the matching between video instances. We evaluate our approach on video retrieval, action step localization, and few-shot action recognition, and achieve consistent performance gain over all three tasks. Detailed ablation studies are provided to justify the approach design.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nRepresentation learning on videos has achieved success~\\citep{goroshin2015unsupervised,feichtenhofer2021large} in detecting actions in short periods. Recent work has extended it on video-text data~\\citep{miech2019howto100m,radford2021learning} to learn a common feature space for zero-shot transfer. In particular, given a paragraph of description, the understanding of \\longvideo{s} is increasingly important and may facilitate AI-assistant applications~\\citep{grauman2022ego4d,lin2022learning,chen2022weakly}.\n\nA \\longvideo{} is usually formulated as a sequence of \\shortclip{s}. Given a paragraph, each sentence is used to describe, \\ie, paired with, the consecutive video clips in a video segment. \nBy matching all sentence-clip pairs~\\citep{miech2020end}, the full video and the paragraph can be aligned implicitly.\nHowever, maximizing the agreement between clips and sentences individually (\\emph{unit-level}) ignores the context of temporal dynamics, which limits the generalization~\\citep{goyal2017something}. \nAfter all, within one video segment, as the action/event progress at each clip varies, the similarity between the clips and the sentence can be naturally different. \nAs such, strictly aligning the sentence with all paired clips, serving as the hard-label, may not always result in an optimal solution. \n\nTo incorporate the temporal correlation across clips, \\citet{xu2021videoclip} propose to first fuse the representations over a short period for sentences and video clips separately and then align the fused representations. \nHowever, such methods only incorporate the \\textit{local} temporal information but still does not model the \\textit{global} temporal correlation.\nAs a paragraph is essentially a sequence of sentences, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:concept}, the whole \\longvideo{} and the paragraph should be explicitly compared and aligned (\\emph{sequence-level}).\nFor a video consisting of multiple steps, \\eg, instructional video, the temporal dependence between two distant video clips still exists.\nIn this way, for a challenging case where two clips are visually similar but are from different segments (clips $\\{a,b,d\\}$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig:concept}), the global context of order can be utilized to avoid the potential mismatching in unit-level matching.\n\nIn this work, we study video-paragraph pre-training and propose a framework \\approach{} based on sequence-level comparison to explore temporal dynamics.\nWe directly calculate the distance between full video and paragraph.\nWithout loss of generality, for the paragraph (anchor) and its paired video (positive sample), the sequence-level distance is the minimum cumulative matching cost over the sentences and clips under the constraint of temporal order and is obtained via dynamic time warping (DTW)~\\citep{muller2007dynamic}.\nThen we emphasize the unit order which is naturally exhibited within a sequence, and consider the cases where the temporal consistency between video and paragraph is not met.\nAs a sentence is paired with a segment consisting of multiple clips, we design a negative sampling strategy based on \\negkey{}, which shuffles the clips at both unit level and segment level in the paired video. \nFinally, we apply contrastive learning to maximally align paired video and paragraph.\nIn this way, we can learn representations for clips and sentences which can perceive global temporal context. Then, from the optimal matching with minimum sequence-level distance, we can pair clips with sentences without being confused by visual similarity.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{result/concept.pdf}\n    \\caption{(Left) Given a video and a paired paragraph where the sentences can describe the content in different parts, the temporal orders within the video and the paragraph are consistent. (Right) Conventional methods perform unit-level comparison between sentences and clips pair-wisely and mismatch may occur due to visual similarity. Instead, we directly compare the sequences by considering temporal order such that the temporal succession can be used to align clips and captions.}\n    \\label{fig:concept}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn addition to video-paragraph pre-training, our \\approach{} can also be generalized on few-shot action recognition (\\votype{}) where each video is classified through the nearest neighbor search according to the sequence distance. \nIn summary, the contributions are:\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\n    \\item We propose a contrastive learning framework \\approach{} to explore temporal dynamics where the learned representation for clips and sentences can facilitate the alignment between sequences.  \n    \\item Given an anchor, we design a negative sampling strategy based on \\negkey{} and shuffle the units in the positive sequence at both segment-level and unit-level. Notably, our method can be generalized to learn representation for both \\vltype{} data and \\votype{} data.\n    \\item We conduct extensive experiments on three tasks (\\ie, video retrieval, action step localization, and few-shot action recognition) and achieve consistent performance gain to demonstrate the effect of our training strategy. Detailed ablation studies are provided to justify the approach design.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\bitem{Contrastive learning} (CT) has achieved success on images~\\citep{chen2020improved,he2020momentum} and can cluster samples in the feature space properly.\nThe main idea is to group different views of the same image/video instance by minimizing the InfoNCE loss~\\citep{oord2018representation} while \\citet{wang2020understanding} explains it from the aspect of uniformity. Besides, it can be applied on imbalanced dataset~\\citep{caron2020unsupervised} and different feature spaces~\\citep{grill2020bootstrap,ma2021partner}.\n\n\\bitem{Self-supervision on Video} has been studied to learn a good feature extractor. \nFollowing the idea of temporal jigsaw~\\cite{huo2020self}, the order of frames~\\citep{misra2016shuffle,lee2017unsupervised} and clips~\\citep{xu2019self} can be used for supervision. However, the length of tuple is fixed and too small (\\eg, 4) to model temporal context over the full video and may ignore semantic information.\nBesides, contrastive learning is also applied for video pre-training where the positive samples can be built by randomly selecting shot video clips~\\citep{feichtenhofer2021large}, adjusting the time span~\\citep{recasens2021broaden}, and performing spatial-temporal augmentation~\\citep{jenni2020video}. In addition, generative approaches~\\cite{han2020memory,vondrick2016generating} has also been studied.\n\n\\bitem{Multi-modal pre-training for zero-shot transfer} has been studied to connect vision and language. CLIP~\\citep{radford2021learning} applies contrastive learning on image-caption pairs.\n\\citet{yang2022unified} and \\citet{li2022grounded} further modify the negative sampling strategy such that the embeddings can be more discriminative at instance-level. \nThen the pre-training is extended to video understanding~\\citet{miech2020end,ging2020coot,gabeur2020multi,alayrac2020self,wang2022object}. To improve the performance,  multi-task training has been studied~\\citep{li2020hero,luo2020univl}. \nAs the description of video content can be noisy, TAN~\\citep{han2022temporal} proposes a co-training strategy and use mutual agreement for annotation filtering and VideoCLIP~\\citep{xu2021videoclip} proposes a sampling strategy to mitigate the impact of noise in long videos labeling.\nBesides video and text, audio is also used to benefit the zero-shot tasks~\\citep{chen2021multimodal,shvetsova2022everything} by learning a common feature space.\nAs an alternative, the Attention mechanism can also be used to fuse the multi-modal information at each layer~\\citep{sun2019videobert,su2019vl,chen2020uniter}.\n\n\\bitem{Sequence alignment} For each unit in a sequence, along the temporal order, the indices of matched units from aligned sequence pair shall monotonically increase, and averaged distance over matched units is minimized.\nDynamic time wrapping~\\citep{muller2007dynamic} is first proposed and canonical time warping~\\citep{zhou2009canonical} is then used to align sequences with different feature dimensionality and is applied in deep learning~\\citep{sargin2007audiovisual}.\nMeanwhile, a pyramid deep architecture~\\citep{wang2020alignnet} or attention mechanism~\\citep{bishay2019tarn,zhang2020few,ma2019cdsa} can be designed to integrate multi-scale temporal information into a single feature vector.\nBesides, regularized by the sequence alignment, pre-training strategies are designed for visual-audio/rhythms synchronization~\\citep{cheng2020look,yu2022self}, and video-text alignment~\\citep{xu2021videoclip}. \n\\section{Approach}\n\nWe first provide notation and task formulation in Sec.~\\ref{sec:formulation}. Then, we detail the paradigm of our method in Sec.~\\ref{sec:approach} and explain how to adapt it for different tasks in ~\\ref{sec:application}. \n\n\\subsection{Pre-Training Task Formulation}\\label{sec:formulation}\n\nGiven an anchor instance $\\mathbf{S}_a$ (\\ie, a paragraph or a video), we aim to learn a network that can minimize its distance with a positive instance $\\mathbf{S}_p$ (\\ie, a video paired with the paragraph or a video of the same semantic class).\nFor each paragraph/video, since its time span can be long, it is typically formulated as a sequence of sentences/video clips. Then, a network is trained to extract a feature for each sentence/video clip, resulting in a sequence of feature embeddings, \\ie, $\\mathbf{S}_a = \\{\\mathbf{s}_a^i\\}_{i=1}^{N_a}$ and $\\mathbf{S}_p = \\{\\mathbf{s}_p^j\\}_{j=1}^{N_p}$, where $\\mathbf{s}_a^i, \\mathbf{s}_p^j \\in \\mathcal{R}^d$ are the sequence units, $N_a$ and $N_p$ are the sequence lengths, and $d$ is the dimension of the common feature space. \nIn a pair of video and paragraph, the sentence can be mapped with a few consecutive clips, \\ie, $\\mathbf{s}_a^i$ is matched with $\\{\\mathbf{s}_p^j\\}_{j=t_i^0}^{t_i^1}$ where $\\{t_i^0,t_i^1\\}$ are the starting and ending feature indexes in $\\mathbf{S}_p$ for $\\mathbf{s}_a^i$. Then, $N_a$ is not necessarily equal to $N_p$.\nIn this way, as the intrinsic temporal orders within $\\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\\mathbf{S}_p$ are consistent, their distance $d_{\\{\\mathbf{S}_a,\\mathbf{S}_p\\}}$ should be small. In contrast, two sequences should be distant from each other if they cannot be aligned.\n\n\\subsection{Temporal Alignment Representation with Contrastive Learning}\\label{sec:approach}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.97\\textwidth]{result/approach.pdf}\n    \\caption{(Left) For each video-paragraph pair, each sentence describes one segment consisting of consecutive video clips. \n    (Right) We set the paragraph (\\ie, sequence of sentences) as anchor $\\mathbf{S}_a$ and set the paired video (\\ie, sequence of clips) as positive sample $\\mathbf{S}_p$. Then, we shuffle the units in $\\mathbf{S}_p$ to generate a negative sequence $\\mathbf{S}_n$ as the temporal succession in $\\mathbf{S}_n$ is not consistent with $\\mathbf{S}_a$. For clip shuffling, we first alter segments and then optionally shuffle the clips in each segment.}\n    \\label{fig:approach}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\revise{In this section, we explain our contrastive(CT)-based training framework \\approach{}. We consider the sequences consisting successive steps of a common topic. Then, we propose our negative sampling strategy and choose to use sequence-level comparison to directly calculate the distance.}\n\nThe temporal dynamics exhibited in each sequence (\\ie, paragraph or video) are representative. To align two sequences, it is also important to ensure the units within the sequences are properly matched. \nFor example, as $\\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\\mathbf{S}_p$ are of temporal consistency, when $\\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\\mathbf{S}_p$ are aligned, each unit $\\mathbf{s}_a^i$ in $\\mathbf{S}_a$ should also be matched with $\\mathbf{s}_p^j$ in $\\mathbf{S}_p$ where $\\mathbf{s}_a^i$ and $\\mathbf{s}_p^j$ are assumed to be semantically close to each other.\nIn this way, when two features $(\\mathbf{s}_p^i,\\mathbf{s}_p^j)$ in $\\mathbf{S}_p$ are of two different actions but hard to be distinguished due to visual similarity, the network can still utilize the global temporal order to find a proper unit-level matching between $\\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\\mathbf{S}_p$ (shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:concept}).\n\n\\bitem{Negative Sampling based on \\NegKey{}.} In contrast, for a negative sequence $\\mathbf{S}_n = \\{\\mathbf{s}_n^j\\}_{j=1}^{N_n}$ which does not preserve temporal consistency with $\\mathbf{S}_a$ where $N_n$ is the sequence length, the distance $d_{\\{\\mathbf{S}_a,\\mathbf{S}_n\\}}$ between $\\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\\mathbf{S}_n$ should be high. After all, when $\\mathbf{S}_a$ cannot be aligned with $\\mathbf{S}_n$, considering the global temporal order, each unit $\\mathbf{s}_n^j$ is also distant from any units $\\mathbf{s}_a^i$ in $\\mathbf{S}_a$ though $\\mathbf{s}_a^i$ and $\\mathbf{s}_n^j$ can be visually similar (\\eg, similar background or foreground objects). \n\nAs such, to mitigate the impact from spatial information, we consider preserving temporal order and aim to obtain representations that facilitates the alignment.\nIn detail, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:approach}, we propose to generate negative sequence $\\mathbf{S}_n$ by randomly shuffling $\\mathbf{S}_p$ and breaking temporal consistency.\nSince the segment-level matching also exists in the paired sequences, we first alter the segment order and then shuffle the units within each segment.\nTo effectively compare $\\mathbf{S}_n$ and $\\mathbf{S}_p$ with $\\mathbf{S}_a$, we propose a training framework \\approach{} based on contrastive learning.\n\n\\bitem{Contrastive learning} (\\ctloss{}) is a self-supervision approach by learning to group the samples with high correlation. \\ctloss{} treats different views of the same instance as correlated (positive) and builds negative pairs by sampling views from different instances. \nAs each instance is an image in~\\citet{chen2020simple}, each view can be generated by performing augmentation on the low-level pixels, \\ie, adding effects such as flipping and color distortion.\nIn practice, given a set $\\mathcal{B}$ with $N_B$ instances, for each instance with one single view $I \\in \\mathcal{B}$, another view $I'$ is generated and is then used to build a positive pair with $I$ where the view of other instances in $\\mathcal{B}$ are used to build negative pairs with $I$. Then, the training objective is to minimize the InfoNCE loss~\\citep{oord2018representation},\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:Con}\n    \\conloss{}(I,I',\\mathcal{B}_n) = -\\log \\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{z}_{I} \\cdot \\mathbf{z}_{I'} / \\tau )}{\\exp(\\mathbf{z}_{I} \\cdot \\mathbf{z}_{I'} / \\tau ) + \\sum\\nolimits_{X \\in \\mathcal{B}_n} \\exp( \\mathbf{z}_{I} \\cdot \\mathbf{z}_{X}  / \\tau )}.\n\\end{equation}\n\\noindent where $\\mathcal{B}_n = \\mathcal{B} \\setminus \\{I\\}$, $\\mathbf{z}_{X} \\in \\mathcal{R}^d$ is the feature for instance $X$ after $l_2$-normalization and $\\tau$ is a hyperparameter to rescale the affinity scores. \nIn this way, \\ctloss{} is performing pair-wise comparison where the disagreement between $\\mathbf{z}_{I}$ and $\\mathbf{z}_{I'}$ is induced by the variation of augmentation.\n\nNote, for our approach \\approach{}, $\\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\\mathbf{S}_p$ served as \\emph{two different views} and the \\emph{pattern of temporal order that is consistent between $\\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\\mathbf{S}_p$ is treated as the instance from which the views are augmented}.\nThen, we can derive the training objective, \\ie, \n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:approach}\n    \\seqloss{}(\\mathbf{S}_a,\\mathbf{S}_p,\\mathcal{S}_n) = - \\log \\frac{\\exp(d_{\\{\\mathbf{S}_a,\\mathbf{S}_p\\}} / \\tau )}{exp(d_{\\{\\mathbf{S}_a,\\mathbf{S}_p\\}} / \\tau ) + \\sum\\nolimits_{\\mathbf{S}_n \\in \\mathcal{S}_n} \\exp( d_{\\{\\mathbf{S}_a,\\mathbf{S}_n\\}}  / \\tau )}\n\\end{equation}\n\\noindent where $\\mathcal{S}_n = \\{\\mathbf{S}_{n}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ is the set of $N$ negative sequences derived from $\\mathbf{S}_p$.\nAs a complementary component, the sequences generated from other instances unpaired or uncorrelated with $\\mathbf{S}_a$ can also be included in $\\mathcal{S}_n$. However, it introduces more computation workload but does not improve performance effectively (analyzed in Sec.~\\ref{sec:negative}). As such, for each $\\mathbf{S}_a$, we only use the shuffling strategy for negative sample generation. \nBy minimizing $\\seqloss{}$, $\\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\\mathbf{S}_p$ are trained to be close to each other while both of them are pushed away from all negative sequences in $\\mathcal{S}_n$. Meanwhile, comparing with unit-level comparison between captions and clips, our approach provides a soft supervision on unit-level comparison and we provide detailed comparison in Sec.~\\ref{sec:gradient}.\n\n\\bitem{Sequence-level distance.} To jointly consider the unit-level matching in sequence alignment, we choose to use Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW, \\citet{muller2007dynamic}), which calculates the minimum cumulative matching costs over units as the sequence distance. The set of matched units is called optimal alignment and is recorded in a matching matrix $M \\in \\mathcal{R}^{N_a \\times N_p}$ with binary indicators.\n\nThere are two constraints in DTW, 1) $\\forall \\mathbf{s}_p^j \\in \\mathbf{S}_p$ is supposed to be matched with at least one unit in $\\mathbf{S}_a$, \\ie, $\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq N_a} \\matchmat{i,j} \\geq 1$ for $\\forall j \\in \\{1...N_p\\}$, and vice versa; 2) Following the exhibited temporal order, the index of matched units should be monotonously increasing, \\ie, if $\\mathbf{s}_p^n$ matches $\\mathbf{s}_a^m$ where $1 \\leq m \\leq N_a$ and $1 \\leq n < N_p$, $\\mathbf{s}_p^{n+1}$ cannot match with any unit in $\\{\\mathbf{s}_a^i\\}_{i=1}^{m-1}$ and $\\sum_{1 \\leq i < m} \\matchmat{i,j} = 0$.\nThus, for $\\mathcal{S}_a$ and $\\mathcal{S}_p$, when $\\matchmat{i,j}=1$, $\\mathbf{s}_a^i$ and $\\mathbf{s}_p^j$ are matched and assumed to be semantically close to each other. For implementation, we first calculate the pair-wise matching costs $D \\in \\mathcal{R}^{N_a \\times N_p}$ where $D(i,j)$ is the cost, \\ie, cosine distance~\\citep{singhal2001modern}, between $\\mathbf{s}_a^i$ and $\\mathbf{s}_p^j$. \nThen, DTW employs dynamic programming and sets a matrix $C \\in \\mathcal{R}^{N_a \\times N_p}$ to record the minimum cumulative cost between $\\{\\mathbf{s}_a^i\\}_{i=1}^{n_a}$ and $\\{\\mathbf{s}_p^j\\}_{j=1}^{n_p}$~\\citep{wang2020alignnet,dixit1990optimization}, \\ie,\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:dtw}\n    C(n_a,n_p) = D(n_a,n_p) + \\text{min} \\{C(n_a-1, n_p-1),~C (n_a-1,n_p),~C(n_a,n_p-1)\\}.\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $1 \\leq n_p \\leq N_p$ and $1 \\leq n_a \\leq N_a$. Then, the sequence distance is $d_{\\{\\mathbf{S}_a,\\mathbf{S}_p\\}} = C(N_a,N_p)$.\nBesides, \\citet{cao2020few} propose OTAM, a variant of DTW, to avoid restrict boundary constraint DTW~\\citep{muller2007dynamic}. The effect of DTW and OTAM in \\approach{} are also studied in Sec.~\\ref{sec:experiment} \\& \\ref{sec:discussion}.\n\n\\subsection{Adaptation for Pretraining Tasks}\\label{sec:application}\n\nWe briefly explain how to apply the paradigm to align the video and paragraph in one semantically-correlated pair (\\vltype{}) or videos of the same class (\\votype{}) during network training.\n\n\\textbf{Video-Paragraph.} For each \\longvideo{}, a paired paragraph consisting of short sentences is provided and every sentence, \\ie, caption, describes the visual content within a temporal segment. \nFirstly, for paragraph, we learn a text encoder to extract feature $\\mathbf{s}_a^{i}$ for each sentence.\nThen, for the video, all frames are grouped into non-overlapping consecutive video clips and each clip, serving as a visual token, has $n_f$ frames. Thus, each sentence is paired with multiple consecutive clips.\nWe use a backbone to extract token embedding for each clip.\nThen, a video encoder is trained to map each clip embedding to the clip feature where all clip features for all sentences are concatenated as $\\mathbf{S}_p$.\nAs the segments for different sentences may have overlap, during training, we will sub-select the sentences to have $\\mathbf{S}_a$ such that there is no repeating clips in $\\mathbf{S}_p$.\n\n\\textbf{Video-only.} Since the duration of action is usually short, we formulate the video as the sequence of frames. As there is no temporal segmentation within each action, we generate the negative sequences by directly shuffling the frames.\nIn this way, the network is learned in a self-supervised manner.\n\nWe first conduct experiments on video retrieval and action step localization to explain the benefit of \\approach{} for zero-shot transfer in long video understanding.\nThen, we explain the experiments on few-shot action recognition to indicate the generalization ability from global temporal modelling on new classes.\nFor the convenience of description, we interchangeably use caption and sentence.\n\n\\subsection{Implementation Details of Video-Text Pre-Training}\n\nWe follow \\citet{xu2021videoclip} and use HowTo100M (HT100M)~\\citep{miech2019howto100m} for pre-training. \nAs HT100M is too large (~1.2M videos), due to limited computation resource, we build our model on top of the VideoCLIP~\\citep{xu2021videoclip} \\ie, initialize the VideoCLIP network with its fully-trained model, and randomly select 90k videos (7.5\\%) of HT100M to update the network by minimizing $\\seqloss{}$. \nVideoCLIP consists of two Transformers~\\citep{vaswani2017attention} as encoders for video and paragraph separately. For each clip, they use its S3D feature~\\citep{xie2018rethinking} as embedding.\nFor each sentence, the token embeddings are obtained via a lookup table~\\citep{devlin2018bert}.\nOne MLP layer is set to map clip embeddings and align the dimension of sentence embeddings. \nDuring pre-training, all encoder parameters are updated.\nMore experiment details can be found in Appendix.\n\n\\subsection{Video-Text Downstream Evaluation}\n\n\\subsubsection{Video Retrieval}\n\n\\subfile{../result/table_fullvideo}\n\\subfile{../result/table_retrieval}\n\n\\bitem{Setup and Metric.} We evaluate our approach under two settings \\setup{Full-Video} and \\setup{Caption-Clip}. (\\setup{Full-Video}) Given a paragraph which contains a set of sentence queries, describing multiple parts of an entire \\longvideo{}, the full video should be directly retrieved. To represent the full video, we can either concatenate all clips which have paired captions (\\ie, remove background), or directly use the full video with background. \nFor retrieval, we can use DTW to measure the distance between the full video and the paragraph directly. Meanwhile, we can still utilize the unit-level comparison, \\ie, each caption can be used to match the clip first and the video with the most matched clips will be retrieved, \\ie, Cap. Avg.\n(\\setup{Caption-Clip}) given a sentence description as a query, we retrieve the video clips directly.\nFor both setups, we use recall as metrics, \\ie, R@1, R@5, R@10.\n\n\\bitem{Dataset.} We evaluate the model pretrained with our \\approach{} on YoucookII\\citep{zhou2018towards} without any finetuning (\\ie, zero-shot). The evaluation set consists of 3350 caption-clip pairs from 436 videos in total.\nThe videos existing in YouCookII have been removed from HT100M.\n\n\\bitem{Result.} \n(\\setup{Full-Video}) \nAs summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:full-retrieval}, with Cap. Avg as measurement, when background is removed, VideoCLIP has already outperformed MCN clearly (\\tablerow{3,4}). However, as VideoCLIP is not trained to explore the global temporal context, the performance drops when DTW is used as measurement.\nIn contrast, though our approach is only trained with 7.5\\% of HT100M full set, benefiting from temporal modelling, \\approach{} can effectively improve the performance (\\tablerow{5,7}) without hurting the retrieval between clips and captions (\\tablerow{4,6}).\nThen, we assume no temporal annotation is provided for full-video retrieval and retrieve full video containing background.\nAs the spatial information in background may distract the sentence features, comparing with the scenario when background is removed, the recall by \\approach{} drops. \nHowever, from Table~\\ref{tab:full-retrieval} and~\\ref{tab:metric}, by using either OTAM or DTW for video-paragraph comparison, our \\approach{} can outperform the VideoCLIP baseline consistently.  \n(\\setup{Caption-Clip}) As summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:unit-retrieval}, by minimizing $\\seqloss{}$, the attention mechanism in Transformer is trained to embed global temporal information into each clip feature, which may then facilitate the such unit-level retrieval and achieves slight gain over strong baseline VideoCLIP. For MMFT, the extra audio information can be used to benefit the retrieval.\n\n\\subfile{../result/table_loc}\n\n\\subsubsection{Action Step Localization}\n\n\\bitem{Setup and Metric.} Each video is associated with a \\underline{T}ask consisting of multiple steps (\\ie, sentences). \nThen, each video frame should be assigned with the corresponding step and we use recall as metric. \n\n\\bitem{Dataset.} We perform evaluation on CrossTask~\\citep{zhukov2019cross} and the test set contains 1690 annotated videos over 18 \\underline{T}asks.\nWe first apply our model pre-trained on HT100M on CrossTask test set for zero-shot evaluation.\nThen, following \\citet{xu2021videoclip}, we finetune the VideoCLIP model on 540 videos with our $\\mathcal(L)_{seq}$ and then evaluate the finetuned model on test set (\\setup{Supervised}).\n\n\\bitem{Result.} (\\setup{Zero-shot}) As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:localization}, when we update VideoCLIP with the 7.5\\% subset using its original loss (\\tablerow{8}), the model overfits and the performance drops slightly. However, for \\approach{}, by adding loss $\\seqloss{}$, we can still improve the recall from 33.9 to 36.9.\n(\\setup{Supervised}) VideoCLIP has shown strong performance, but \\approach{} can still increase the recall to 52.5.\nFurthermore, by finetuning on only 100 videos (20\\% of train set), our approach can effectively improve the performance, which also demonstrates the benefit from exploring the temporal order modelling.\n\n\\subsection{Few-shot Action Recognition}\n\n\\begin{minipage}{\\textwidth}\n  \\begin{minipage}[]{0.47\\textwidth}\n  \\bitem{Setup and  Metric.} Given a \\underline{T}ask where each class has only $N_s$ labeled video as reference (\\ie, $N_s$-shot), we classify a test video by comparing its average distance with labeled videos of each class through nearest neighbor search.\n  Following the protocol \\citep{zhu2018compound}, we first pre-train the model on a dataset of classes $\\mathcal{C}_{b}$ and directly evaluated on few-shot tasks which are sampled from another dataset of classes $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{b} \\cap \\mathcal{C}_{n} = \\O$.\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\hfill\n  \\begin{minipage}[]{0.5\\textwidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\captionof{table}{Performance (\\%) on action recognition.}\n    \\resizebox{0.95\\textwidth}{!}\n    {\n        \\begin{tabular}{l|cc}\n            \\hlineB{3}\n            Approach & 1-shot & 5-shot \\\\\n            \\hline\n            TSN++*   & 33.6 & 43   \\\\\n            CMN++*   & 34.4 & 43.8 \\\\\n            RTRN++*  & 38.6 & 48.9 \\\\\n            OTAM~\\citep{cao2020few}    & 42.8 & 52.3 \\\\\n            TRX~\\citep{perrett2021temporal}     & 42.0   & 64.6 \\\\\n            MTFAN~\\citep{wu2022motion}   & {45.4} & 60.4 \\\\\n            \\approach{} (Ours) & \\textbf{47.8} & \\textbf{67.7} \\\\\n            \\hlineB{3}\n            \\multicolumn{3}{l}{*:Results are reported in \\citet{cao2020few}}\n        \\end{tabular}\\label{tab:fsar}\n    }\n  \\end{minipage}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\bitem{Dataset}. We use sth-sth V2 \\citep{goyal2017something} for experiment and follow the subset split in \\citet{cao2020few}.\nThe subset contains 100 classes where $|\\mathcal{C}_{b}| = 64$ and $|\\mathcal{C}_{n}|$ is 24 (12) classes are for evaluation (validation).\nDuring evaluation, each \\underline{T}ask contains 5 classes and has 15 test videos per class while $N_s = \\{1,5\\}$.\nFinally, we report the mean accuracy over 10k \\underline{T}asks. As only using spatial content is unreliable, temporal modelling is thus specifically required for correct prediction.\n\n\\bitem{Results} For fair comparison, we first use a ResNet50 model pretrained on ImageNet~\\citep{deng2009imagenet} to extract embedding for each frame which are fed into a Transformer to obtain features in $\\mathbf{S}_a$. As for $\\mathbf{S}_p$, we set a linear layer to process each frame embedding. Then, we use the pre-trained model as initialization and follow the training of OTAM and TRX. More details can be found in Sec.~\\ref{sec:downstream-supp}. \\approach{} differs from \\citet{cao2020few} by applying self-supervision and using a shuffled version of $\\mathbf{S}_p$ as $\\mathbf{S}_n$, while they apply meta-training~\\citep{snell2017prototypical} between video instances. TRX also employs a Transformer but only learns the temporal order between a pair/triple of frames and the learning efficiency is limited. In contrast, TempCLR directly models the temporal context.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec:discussion}\n\n\\subsection{Unit Matching in Sequence Alignment}\\label{sec:unit-seq} \nWhen we directly measure the global distance between video and paragraph, it is also very important to ensure the matched caption-clip pairs are semantically close to each other.\nAs visualized in Fig.~\\ref{fig:visualization-main}, for the full video directly retrieved by a paragraph, our approach can also correctly match all captions with the video clips. \nHowever, if we only rely on the unit-level similarity, the high visual similarity can cause false prediction. More visualization can be found in appendix.\n\nIn addition, as shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation}(a), we check percentage of correctly matched clip-caption pairs averaged over all videos.\nThen, our \\approach{} can correctly match more caption-clip pairs than VideoCLIP when the video is compared with paragraph using DTW.\nIn this way, given a paragraph, our approach can also mitigate the distraction from unpaired videos.\n\n\\subfile{../result/table_ablation2}\n\n\\subsection{Negative Sample Selection}\\label{sec:negative}\n\nFor each anchor sequence $\\mathbf{S}_a$, we generate negative samples $\\mathbf{S}_n$ from the positive sample $\\mathbf{S}_p$ by 1) considering the difference regarding temporal granularity and 2) shuffling the order to break the temporal consistency. Then, we discuss alternative strategies.\n\n\\bitem{Video-Paragraph.} For each paragraph (anchor), in addition to shuffle the segments first and then shuffle the clip embeddings within each segment (\\textit{seg-unit}), we can also only shuffling the segments while maintaining the clip order within each segment (\\textit{seg-only}).\nMeanwhile, an intuitive strategy is to use the video unpaired with the anchor to build negative samples (\\textit{unpaired}) or combine it with \\textit{seg-unit} \\textit{joint}.\nIn addition, we can aggressively shuffle all clips embeddings in $\\mathbf{S}_p$ (\\textit{all-unit}), or only shuffle the clip embeddings within each segment (\\textit{within-seg}).\n\nAs shown in Table~\\ref{tab:negative}, we compare the performance on CrossTask under \\textit{Supervised}. \n(1) Since we use VideoCLIP as initialization and the model has been trained to distinguish clips from different video instances, the sequence-level distance of negative samples in \\textit{unpaired} has already been high. Furthermore, as the temporal consistency hardly exists between video and unpaired paragraph, the gain by \\textit{unpaired} is inevitably limited.\n(2) According to \\tablerow{2-4}, since each caption is supposed to align with all of the clips in the paired segment, breaking the order of segments in $\\mathbf{S}_p$, \\ie, \\textit{seg-only} and \\textit{seg-unit}, is essential in facilitating model training.\nFrom Sec.~\\ref{sec:unit-seq}, \\textit{when two sequences are aligned using DTW, the matched units are also semantically close to each other}. Thus, when \n\\begin{minipage}{\\textwidth}\n  \\begin{minipage}[]{0.68\\textwidth}\n  $\\mathbf{S}_a$ is compared with $\\mathbf{S}_n$, the matched units can indicate the clip features which may cause the most confusion in caption-clip matching due to high visual similarity. In this way, by minimizing $\\seqloss{}$, the network is then trained to distinguish those clip features which may hurt the alignment between $\\mathbf{S}_p$ and $\\mathbf{S}_a$.\n  Then, when the segment order is preserved, comparing with VideoCLIP baseline (\\ie, 47.3), \\textit{within-seg} results in worse generalization as the confusing clips across segments are not detected and the model can be trained to overfit to trivial difference between clips under the same segment. In contrast, when the segment order is broken, shuffling the clip\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\hfill\n  \\begin{minipage}[]{0.3\\textwidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\captionof{table}{Ablation study (\\%) of negative sampling.}\n    \\resizebox{\\textwidth}{!}\n    {\n        \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{0.93}\n        \\begin{tabular}{lc|c}\n            \\hlineB{3}\n            Exp. & Strategy & Recall \\\\\n            \\hline\n            1 & un-paired & 48.0\\\\\n            2 & within-seg & 46.4 \\\\\n            3 & seg-only & \\underline{52.1} \\\\\n            4 & seg-unit & \\textbf{52.5} \\\\\n            5 & all-unit & 49.3 \\\\\n            6 & joint & \\textbf{52.5} \\\\\n            7 & visual-anchor & 52.0 \\\\\n            \\hlineB{3}\n        \\end{tabular}\\label{tab:negative}\n    }\n  \\end{minipage}\n\\end{minipage}\norder within each segment further can serve as data augmentation, which can improve the recall slightly from 52.1 to 52.5. Furthermore, (3) \n\\textit{all-unit} only introduce limited gain since the continuity across clips in one segment is broken and it is too hard for the model to learn. Combining \\textit{unpaired} and \\textit{seg-unit} in \\textit{joint} does not provide clear gain over \\textit{seg-unit}. However, we think the main reason is that VideoCLIP has been well-trained for instance discrimination and believe \\textit{joint} is still necessary when \\approach{} is trained from scratch.\nLastly, we can also shuffle the sentence embeddings w.r.t a video (\\textit{visual-anchor}) which is equivalent to \\textit{seg-only} and achieve reasonably high performance.\n\n\\bitem{Video-Only.} As an alternative, we can also shuffle the frame features of other videos as $\\mathbf{S}_n$ and keep training the model in a self-supervised manner. \nHowever, since the distance between different video instances has already been high, the model is not well learned and the accuracy is 38.2. \n\n\\subsection{Component Analysis and Ablation Study}\\label{sec:ablation}\n\n\\bitem{Modelling of global temporal context} has been studied for long-video understanding. A popular way is to employ Transformer architecture to model the correlation between clips automatically.\nHowever, by explicitly modelling the temporal orders, as demonstrated in Sec.~\\ref{sec:experiment}, \\approach{} is capable to provide consistent gain over three tasks under six different setups from the strong baseline.\nThus, the comparison with VideoCLIP already serves as ablation studies to demonstrate the importance of explicit regularization for temporal modelling.\nAfter all, the Attention mechanism may require many data to fully understanding the temporal correlation. \nIn addition, specifically for videos, the labels are noisy such as misalignment between ASR transcription and long video~\\citep{miech2020end}, the attention modelling can also be distracted by background which hurts the training efficiency.\nAs such, our approach provides a general framework aiming to utilize temporal context.\n\n\\bitem{\\textit{Supervised} on CrossTask}. As summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation}, we use CrossTask study the effect of $\\seqloss{}$ in pre-training (PT) stage and downstream finetuning (DS) stage. \nFor \\approach{}, \\ie, with $\\seqloss{}$ in PT, as the model has been trained to model global temporal order, finetuning without $\\mathcal{L}_{seq}$ can also improve the recall.\nMeanwhile, though the temporal pattern learned PT may not exactly the same of data in DS, as finetuning with $\\mathcal{L}_{seq}$ in DS is very important for down-stream evaluation, the performance are comparable when either VideoCLIP or \\approach{} is used for initialization. \n\n\\bitem{DTW Vs. OTAM}. From Table.~\\ref{tab:metric}, as the temporal annotation is given in video-paragraph pretraining, using DTW or OTAM achieves similar performance. However, even when annotation is not given in Video-only task, employing either OTAM or DTW does not impact the performance significantly (47.7 for 1-shot). More details can be found in the appendix.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIn this paper, we have proposed \\approach{}, a contrastive learning framework to align the temporal dynamics exhibited in video-paragraph pre-training, where the paragraph/video can be represented as a sequence of sentences/clips and are learned to match their global content following the consistent temporal order. Specifically, to encourage temporal modeling over the full sequences and the effectiveness of explicit sequence comparison, we propose to generate negative samples by shuffling clips of the paired video from different temporal granularities. In this way, we can adjustably maximize the agreement between sequences with temporal order consistency and maximize the distance between unaligned sequences with different temporal coherency. Our \\approach{} achieves consistent performance gain on three tasks under six different setups, which experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework. We also provide analysis to validate our design choice of negative sampling, which is shown to both benefits the sequence-level alignment and the unit-level matching.\n\n\\noindent{\\bf Acknowledgement}\n\\noindent This material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000. \nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Government purposes notwithstanding any copyright notation therein. \nThe views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies or endorsements, either expressed or implied, of Air Force Laboratory, DARPA or the U.S. Government.\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 2>\n\n<paper 3>\n\\title{Multi-granularity Correspondence Learning from Long-term Noisy Videos}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nExisting video-language studies mainly focus on learning short video clips, leaving long-term temporal dependencies rarely explored due to over-high computational cost of modeling long videos. To address this issue, one feasible solution is learning the correspondence between video clips and captions, which however inevitably encounters the multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) problem. To be specific, MNC refers to the clip-caption misalignment (coarse-grained) and frame-word misalignment (fine-grained), hindering temporal learning and video understanding. In this paper, we propose NOise Robust Temporal Optimal traNsport (Norton) that addresses MNC in a unified optimal transport (OT) framework. In brief, Norton employs video-paragraph and clip-caption contrastive losses to capture long-term dependencies based on OT. To address coarse-grained misalignment in video-paragraph contrast, Norton filters out the irrelevant clips and captions through an alignable prompt bucket and realigns asynchronous clip-caption pairs based on transport distance. To address the fine-grained misalignment, Norton incorporates a soft-maximum operator to identify crucial words and key frames. Additionally, Norton exploits the potential faulty negative samples in clip-caption contrast by rectifying the alignment target with OT assignment to ensure precise temporal modeling. Extensive experiments on video retrieval, videoQA, and action segmentation verify the effectiveness of our method. \nCode is available at {\\href{https://lin-yijie.github.io/projects/Norton}{https://lin-yijie.github.io/projects/Norton}}.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nVideo-Language Pre-training (VLP) has emerged as a popular approach for video understanding~\\citep{milnce,bain2021frozen,ge2022bridging,wang2022contrastive,luo2020univl} in recent years. Although promising results have been achieved, the pioneer works are mainly devoted to learning short video clips while overlooking long-term temporal dependencies. In practice, it is generally acknowledged that the long-term temporal dependency plays an indispensable role in understanding the relationships and transitions over time in various applications such as video-paragraph retrieval~\\citep{tempclr,sun2022long} and action segmentation~\\citep{coin}.\n\nTo learn the long-term temporal correspondence from the long videos, one important challenge is the heavy demand for computation resources. For example, \\cite{tan,bertasius2021space} employ long-form vision transformers to capture the temporal correlation, which involves computing cross-attention among every frame in long videos. As long videos are typically composed of a sequence of short video clips according to ASR timestamps~\\citep{milnce}, an alternative approach is to explore the temporal correlation among video clips and captions. For instance, TempCLR~\\citep{tempclr} uses Dynamic Time Warping~\\citep{muller2007dynamic,softdtw,zhou2009canonical} to measure the sequential distance between video clips and captions, and incorporates the temporal correlation across clips by contrasting the video with the paragraph. This strategy is remarkably efficient than directly modeling the entire video, making it an attractive option for learning long-term temporal correspondence.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{fig/motivation}\n\\caption{Our observation on multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) in video understanding. \n(\\textit{Left}) The green timeline denotes the alignable captions while the red timeline indicates the unalignable captions. The green text in $\\mathbf{t}_5$ denotes partially correlated words w.r.t $\\mathbf{v}_5$.\n (\\textit{Right}) The dashed line represents the original alignment according to timestamps and the red block indicates the misaligned clip-caption pair. The green block denotes the ground-truth alignment. The solid line denotes the re-alignment by Dynamic Time Warping~\\citep{muller2007dynamic} which struggles to handle noisy correspondence well. \n}\n\\label{fig:BasicIdea}\n\\end{figure}\n\nHowever, dividing long videos into short clips would inevitably introduce an accompanied challenge, \\ie, multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC).\nAs shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:BasicIdea}, MNC refers to the misaligned video-text pairs at two different granularities:\ni) \\textit{Coarse-grained misalignment (Clip-caption).} Coarse-grained misalignment includes \\textit{asynchronous} and \\textit{irrelevant} misalignments according to whether a clip/caption is alignable with the captions/clips in the long video. \nTo be specific, asynchronous misalignment refers to temporal misalignment between subtitles and visual clips, \\eg, $\\mathbf{t}_1$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig:BasicIdea}. It often occurs when people explain their actions before or after actually performing them, resulting in the mismatch between the order of statements and actions. \nOn the other hand, irrelevant misalignment refers to irrelevant or meaningless captions that cannot be aligned with any available video clips (\\eg, $\\mathbf{t}_2$ and $\\mathbf{t}_6$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig:BasicIdea}), and vice versa for video clips. According to~\\cite{tan}, only 30\\% of clip-caption pairs are visually aligned in HowTo100M~\\citep{howto100m}, with even fewer 15\\% being naturally well-aligned; \nii) \\textit{Fine-grained misalignment (Frame-word).} Within each video clip, the narration sentences may only partially correlate with the visual frames. As depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:BasicIdea}, ``the sugar goes on top\" in $\\mathbf{t}_5$ is strongly correlated with visual content $\\mathbf{v}_5$ while the action ``watch the glaze take off\" is uncorrelated. Irrelevant words or frames can distort the identification of crucial ones and result in inaccurate similarity measurements, further contaminating the clip-caption alignment. \nNote that only a few methods~\\citep{tan} consider the coarse-grained misalignment problem in temporal learning while none of them realize this fine-grained misalignment problem. \nUndoubtedly, MNC poses a significant obstacle to effective temporal modeling.\n\nTo this end, we propose NOise Robust Temporal Optimal traNsport (Norton), a unified optimal transport approach for addressing multi-granularity noisy correspondence in temporal learning. Specifically, Norton proposes a video-paragraph and a clip-caption contrastive loss based on optimal transport (OT) to explore the temporal correlations. \n\nIn video-paragraph contrast, Norton employs OT to measure sequence distances between video clips and captions from a fine-to-coarse perspective. To handle fine-grained misalignment, Norton incorporates a token-wise soft-maximum operator to identify crucial words and key frames within each clip-caption pair. This operator improves the measurement of clip-caption similarity from fine-grained multi-modal interactions. Building upon this clip-caption similarity, Norton establishes a flexible assignment between clips and captions by maximizing the global alignment similarity of OT. \nBased on the transport assignment, Norton realigns each video clip to multiple related captions, and vice versa, thereby mitigating the asynchronous misalignment. To further address the irrelevant misalignment, Norton introduces an alignable prompt bucket which serves as a candidate alignable target for noisy clips or captions.\nBy discarding the ones aligned to the bucket, Norton effectively filters out meaningless content during the OT process. Note that our late interaction between clips and captions through OT alleviates the computational cost of directly modeling long videos.\n\nIn clip-caption contrast, Norton tackles the faulty negative problem~\\citep{chuang2020debiased,yang2021partially} through OT. Specifically, semantically similar clip and captions would be wrongly treated as negatives in contrastive learning~\\citep{chen2020simple,lin2021completer,lin2022dcp,liu2022scc} and impact the clip-wise representation. Norton leverages OT assignments of within-batch clip-caption pairs as additional supervision in clip-caption contrastive loss, which exploits potential faulty negative samples and improves temporal learning.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are summarized below:\n\\begin{itemize}\n[leftmargin=*,topsep=-1pt,itemsep=0ex]\n\\item We reveal multi-granularity noisy correspondence problem in temporal learning, which refers to coarse-grained asynchronous and irrelevant misalignments, as well as fine-grained misalignment.\n\\item We achieve efficient and robust  correspondence learning by incorporating several innovative components such as the soft-maximum operator, alignable prompt bucket, and faulty negative exploitation within the optimal transport framework. Extensive experiments on various tasks including video retrieval, videoQA, and action segmentation verify its effectiveness. \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\paragraph{Video Temporal Learning.} \nTemporal learning is a critical yet challenging topic in video understanding. Traditional works focus on integrating spatial-temporal operations into convolution~\\citep{feichtenhofer2019slowfast} or Transformer architectures~\\citep{bertasius2021space,wang2022all,sun2022long}. Inspired by image-language pre-training approaches~\\citep{clip,align}, recent works leverage natural language to guide video temporal learning. Among these works, one scheme is ``sorting the clips\"~\\citep{merlot,zeng2023tvtsv2,zeng2022learning,ma2023temporal} which involves ranking the video clips according to their sequential sentences. While effective, this framework generally requires encoding long video into one sequence and entails significant computational resources. Another type of scheme proposes to leverage Dynamic Time Warping~\\citep{tempclr, muller2007dynamic,dropdtw} to measure the sequence distance between video clips and captions, and achieve temporal learning by aligning the video with the corresponding paragraph. \n\nAlthough promising results have been achieved, existing temporal learning methods suffer from the noisy correspondence problem where the ground truth order of captions w.r.t. video clips does not conform to the original timestamp order. This issue can significantly impact temporal learning, leading to suboptimal results for sorting-based and DTW-based approaches. \nDifferent from these works, this paper is dedicated to solving noisy correspondence in temporal learning and accordingly proposes an MNC-robust optimal transport framework that effectively measures sequence similarity between noisy video and paragraph.\n\n\\paragraph{Noisy Correspondence Learning in Video-language Pre-training.} Video-language pre-training has achieved promising progress thanks to large-scale datasets such as HowTo100M~\\citep{howto100m}. As the text description is often not well-aligned to the visual content~\\citep{tan}, noisy correspondence learning~\\citep{huang2021learning,gao2021clip2tv} becomes a new fashion in VLP. To be specific, MIL-NCE~\\citep{milnce} first studies this problem by simply aligning each video clip with multiple adjacent sentences to mitigate the impact of noise.\nTAN~\\citep{tan} proposes a co-training strategy that uses mutual agreement to filter out the noisy pairs. Different from the above on-the-fly noise rectified methods, Decembert~\\citep{decembert} generates high-quality video descriptions using an off-the-shelf image captioning model from a data collection aspect.\n\nOur method differs from existing works in two key aspects. First, the above noisy correspondence methods only consider coarse-grained asynchrony while ignoring the frame-word misalignment problem. In contrast, we point out that fine-grained misalignment can impact temporal learning and accordingly propose a unified optimal transport approach that effectively addresses noisy correspondence at both coarse and fine-grained levels.\nSecond, our method is computationally efficient with a low memory cost. It operates in a bootstrapping manner without requiring additional models, \\eg, dual networks~\\citep{tan}, momentum networks~\\citep{albef,tan}, or image caption models~\\citep{decembert}. These advantages make our approach more practical and scalable for real-world applications.\n\n\\paragraph{Optimal Transport.} OT is originally proposed to depict the distance between two probability distributions. Recently, OT has gained significant attention in various fields such as domain adaptation~\\citep{xu2020reliable}, clustering~\\citep{caron2020unsupervised}, document matching~\\citep{yu2022optimal,kusner2015word}, and sequence alignment~\\citep{su2017order,liu2022learning}. However, none of these works specifically focus on the alignment of video and text, which is the primary focus of our research. In addition to addressing the traditional sequence alignment, we point out the fine-grained misalignment problem that is specific to video-text learning. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-grained alignment effectively improves temporal learning.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{fig/framework}\n\\caption{\nOverview of our multi-granularity correspondence learning. We perform video-paragraph contrastive learning to capture long-term temporal correlations from a fine-to-coarse perspective. Specifically, we first utilize the log-sum-exp operator on the frame-word similarity matrix to obtain fine-grained similarity between clip and caption. Additionally, we append an alignable prompt bucket on the clip-caption similarity matrix to filter out the irrelevant clips or captions. By applying Sinkhorn iterations on the clip-caption similarity matrix, we effectively tackle the asynchronous problem and obtain the optimal transport distance as the video-paragraph similarity.\n}\n\\label{fig:framework}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Method}\n\n\\label{sec:method}\n\nIn this section, we first introduce the overall pre-training objective of Norton in Section~\\ref{sec:3.1}. Subsequently, we elaborate on our multi-granularity correspondence learning in Section~\\ref{sec:3.2} and explain how to exploit the faulty negative samples in clip-caption contrastive learning in Section~\\ref{sec:3.3}. \n\n\\subsection{Pre-training Objective}\n\\label{sec:3.1}\n\nGiven an instructional video dataset $\\mathcal{D}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{V}_i, \\mathbf{T}_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^N$, where $\\mathbf{V}_i$ and $\\mathbf{T}_i$ represent the video and paragraph of $i$-th instance, we formulate each video/paragraph as a sequence of video clips/captions according to the ASR timestamps. Specifically, we mark the video clips and captions in $i$-th video as $\\{\\mathbf{v}_a\\}_{a=1}^n$ and $\\{\\mathbf{t}_b\\}_{b=1}^m$. Here $\\{\\mathbf{v}_a^j\\}_{j=1}^f$ and $\\{\\mathbf{t}_b^j\\}_{j=1}^w$ represent the frames and words within $\\mathbf{v}_a$ and $\\mathbf{t}_b$, where $f$ and $w$ represent the length of the clip and caption. Based on the above definitions, we propose the following training objectives:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\mathcal{L}=\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{clip}}+\\lambda \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{video}},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere video-paragraph contrastive loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{video}}$ explores the temporal correlations between the long video $\\mathbf{V}_i$ and its corresponding paragraph $\\mathbf{T}_i$ through a novel noise robust temporal optimal transport distance. The clip-caption contrastive loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{clip}}$ exploits potential faulty negative samples to improve clip representation and ensure accurate temporal modeling. We will elaborate on these two losses in the following sections.\n\n\\subsection{Correspondence Learning via Robust Optimal Transport}\n\\label{sec:3.2}\n\nAs long videos are typically composed of a sequence of short video clips, we propose to use the optimal transport distance between video clips and captions as the similarity criterion for video-paragraph contrastive learning in a robust and efficient way. \n\nLet $\\mathbf{S} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$ denote the clip-caption similarity matrix where $[\\mathbf{S}]_{a,b}$ measures the similarity between clip $\\textbf{v}_a$ and caption $\\textbf{t}_b$. $\\mathbf{Q}\\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n\\times m}$ denotes the corresponding  transport assignment where $[\\mathbf{Q}]_{a,b}$ represents the probabilities of aligning $\\textbf{v}_a$ with $\\textbf{t}_b$.\nOptimal transport seeks to establish a flexible alignment between clips and captions by maximizing global similarity $\\langle \\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{S}\\rangle=\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{Q}^\\top\\mathbf{S})$.\nFormally, the objective of optimal transport is defined as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\begin{aligned}\n \\max _{\\mathbf{Q} \\in \\mathcal{Q}} & \\quad \n \\langle\\mathbf{Q},~ \\mathbf{S}\\rangle +\\varepsilon H(\\mathbf{Q})\\\\\n\\text { s.t. } &  \n\\quad \n\\mathcal{Q}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n \\times m} \\mid \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{1}_m=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\mathbf{Q}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_n= \\boldsymbol{\\nu} \\right\\}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\label{eq:ot}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}_m$ represents the vector of ones in dimension $m$, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ indicate the relative importance of each clip or caption. Since each clip or caption is sampled independently, we choose uniform probability distribution $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{n} \\mathbf{1}_n \\text { and } \\boldsymbol{\\nu}=\\frac{1}{m} \\mathbf{1}_m$ to assign equal weight to each instance following~\\cite{su2017order}.\n$H(\\mathbf{Q})$ is an entropy regularizer derived from the optimization perspective~\\citep{sinkhorn} and $\\varepsilon$ controls its smoothness. \n\nAs illustrated in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:ot}), optimal transport can realign each clip or caption to multiple related captions or clips based on global similarity, thus effectively resolving the potential asynchronous misalignment problem between the two modalities. The optimal $\\mathbf{Q}^*$ of Eq.~(\\ref{eq:ot}) has a simple normalized exponential matrix solution by Sinkhorn fixed point iterations~\\citep{sinkhorn}, \n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\t  \\mathbf{Q}^* & =  \\operatorname{Diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_1) \\exp \\left({ \\mathbf{S}}/{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\operatorname{Diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_2),\\\\\n\\text{  with iteratively updated}~&\n\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_1 \\leftarrow \\boldsymbol{\\mu} . /\\left(\\exp\\left({ {\\mathbf{S}}}/{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_2\\right),  ~\n\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_2 \\leftarrow \\boldsymbol{\\nu} . /\\left(\\exp\\left({\\mathbf{S}^{\\top}}/{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_1\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n  \\label{eq:q_ot}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ are the non-negative left and right scaling vectors. \nBy utilizing OT distance between clips and captions as the video-paragraph similarity, our video-paragraph contrastive loss captures the long-term temporal dependencies as follows,\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{video}} = -\n    \\sum_{i=1}^N\n    \\left(\n  \\log \\frac{\n  \\exp \\left(\\langle\\mathbf{Q}_{ii},~\\mathbf{S}_{ii}\\rangle/ \\tau\\right)}\n  {\n  \\sum_{j=1}^N \\exp \\left(\\langle\n  \\mathbf{Q}_{ij},~\\mathbf{S}_{ij}\\rangle / \\tau\\right)}\n  +\n  \\log \\frac{\n  \\exp \\left(\\langle\\mathbf{Q}_{ii},~\\mathbf{S}_{ii}\\rangle/ \\tau\\right)}\n  {\n  \\sum_{j=1}^N \\exp \\left(\\langle\n  \\mathbf{Q}_{ji},~\\mathbf{S}_{ji}\\rangle / \\tau\\right)}\n  \\right)\n  ,\n  \\label{eq:lossseq}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{S}_{ij}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$ is the clip-caption similarity matrix between video $\\mathbf{V}_i$ and paragraph $\\mathbf{T}_j$, $\\mathbf{Q}_{ij}$ is the corresponding transport assignment of $\\mathbf{S}_{ij}$, and $\\tau$ is a learnable temperature initialized as 0.07. Note that when calculating Eq.~(\\ref{eq:lossseq}), we stop the gradient of the transport assignment $\\mathbf{Q}$ to keep the stability of our video-paragraph contrastive loss. To ensure the discriminative capacity of the model, we search the nearest videos as the hard negative samples following~\\cite{videoclip}. By using optimal transport to measure sequence distance instead of directly modeling the long videos, our method significantly reduces computational cost. A detailed training efficiency discussion is placed in Appendix~\\ref{app:timecost}.\n\n \n\nHowever, the optimal transport objective Eq.~(\\ref{eq:ot}) still has some limitations: i) OT estimates the sequence distance based on clip-caption similarity (coarse-grained), leaving word-frame misalignment (fine-grained) problem unexplored; ii) OT requires each source instance must exactly map to the targets, which is not practical when dealing with a large amount of meaningless text. To address these challenges, we propose a soft-maximum operator for fine-grained alignment and an alignment prompt bucket to filter out meaningless clips and captions for noise robust distance estimation.\n\n\\paragraph{Fine-grained Alignment.}\nMost previous works~\\citep{videoclip,tempclr,tan} typically encode frames or words to a global feature using $[\\operatorname{CLS}]$ token or averaging the frame or word embeddings (\\eg, $\\operatorname{AvgPool}(\\{\\mathbf{v}_a^j\\}_{j=1}^f)$). However, such strategies neglect fine-grained interactions between modalities and do not address the problem of frame-word misalignment.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose a cross-modal late interaction mechanism to identify crucial words and key frames for fine-grained alignment inspired by~\\cite{yao2021filip,wang2022disentangled}. Specifically, we define the fine-grained similarity between clip $\\mathbf{v}_a$ and caption $\\mathbf{t}_b$ as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n[\\mathbf{S}]_{a,b}=\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{f}\\sum_{i=1}^{f}\\alpha \\log  \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^w \\exp (\\frac{\\mathbf{v}_a^i\\cdot \\mathbf{t}_b^j}{\\alpha})\\right) + \\frac{1}{w}\\sum_{i=1}^{w}\\alpha \\log  \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^f \\exp (\\frac{\\mathbf{t}_b^i\\cdot \\mathbf{v}_a^j}{\\alpha})\\right)\\right).\n\\label{eq:finegraiend}\n\\end{equation}\n\nTake the front part for example, for each frame in the video clip, we identify the most important words through a soft-maximum operation, \\ie, log-sum-exp approximation~\\citep{beck2012smoothing}, and then compute the average soft-maximum similarities of all frames as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:framework}. Similarly, for each textual token, we also find its related video frames in the latter part of Eq.~(\\ref{eq:finegraiend}). The parameter $\\alpha$ magnifies the importance of the most relevant words or frames. As $\\alpha$ approaches 0, the log-sum-exp approximates the maximum. Specifically, this soft-maximum operation allows us to reduce the negative influence of background words or frames on clip-caption similarity estimation.\n\nThough inspired from~\\cite{wang2022disentangled,yao2021filip}, our method differs in several aspects. Firstly, we introduce a straightforward  log-sum-exp operator as a soft approximation of the maximum. This allows us to concentrate on more crucial words, making it particularly well-suited for video content as opposed to images. Experiments in Table~\\ref{tab:ablations} demonstrate that our design yields a substantial improvement compared to solely focusing on the most important item. Secondly, we leverage the estimated clip-caption similarity for sequence alignment, effectively enhancing temporal learning. In contrast,~\\cite{wang2022disentangled} exclusively concentrates on clip-caption alignment.\n\n  \n \n\n\\paragraph{Alignable Prompt Bucket.} Optimal transport requires every source instance to exactly map to the targets. Yet, in real-world scenarios, a significant amount of captions and video clips might be noisy or irrelevant that cannot be aligned, \\ie, coarse-grained irrelevant misalignments. Motivated by~\\cite{sarlin2020superglue}, we propose an innovative solution that uses an alignable prompt bucket (APB) to filter out semantic irrelevant clips and captions.\nAs shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:framework}, the prompt bucket consists of one new row and column, filled with the same value $p$. The prompt bucket is appended to the similarity matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ that\n\\begin{equation}\n  [\\bar{\\mathbf{S}}]_{a, m+1}=[\\bar{\\mathbf{S}}]_{n+1, b}=[\\bar{\\mathbf{S}}]_{n+1, m+1}=p,\n     ~\n     [\\bar{\\mathbf{S}}]_{a, b} =[{\\mathbf{S}}]_{a, b}, \n      ~\n     \\forall\n  a \\in [1,n],~  b \\in [1,m].\n  \\label{eq:s_hat}\n\\end{equation}\nWhen calculating the transport distance given $\\bar{\\mathbf{S}}$, each video clip can be aligned with either available captions or the prompt bucket. \nSubstituting Eq.~(\\ref{eq:ot}) with Eq.~(\\ref{eq:s_hat}), we obtain the final optimal transport assignment by dropping the last row and column of the transport assignment, \\ie, ${\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}}^*= \\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}^*_{1: n,1:m}$.\n\nFrom an intuitional viewpoint, the prompt value $p$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:s_hat}) serves as a similarity margin that distinguishes between alignable and unalignable clips and captions. If a video clip $\\mathbf{v}_a$ lacks an alignable caption, its pairwise similarities with the set of captions $\\{\\mathbf{t}_b\\}_{b=1}^m$ are generally small. Consequently, if the margin $p$ is larger than these pairwise similarity values, $\\mathbf{v}_a$ is forced to align with the prompt bucket and subsequently filtered from the transport assignment. In our implementation, we determine the value of $p$ as the bottom 30\\% similarity of the original aligned clip-caption pairs in a data-driven manner.\n\n\\subsection{Clip-caption Alignment via Faulty Negative Exploitation}\n\\label{sec:3.3}\n \nSince self-supervised contrastive learning~\\citep{moco} relies on the random sampling of negative instances, captions that are semantically similar to the anchor clips can be treated as faulty negatives~\\citep{han2020self,zolfaghari2021crossclr}, and vice versa. However, the existing one-hot target used in contrastive learning penalizes all negative predictions regardless of their correlations.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, we propose to exploit the faulty negatives through optimal transport. Let $\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{B\\times B}$ denotes the within-batch clip-caption similarity matrix where $B$ represents the number of clips/captions for all videos in the batch. We apply optimal transport on the similarity matrix $\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}$,\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\max _{\\hat{\\mathbf{Q}}\\in \\mathcal{\\hat{Q}}}  \\quad\n\\langle\\hat{\\mathbf{Q}},~ \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}\\rangle +\\varepsilon H(\\hat{\\mathbf{Q}})\n\\quad\n\\text { s.t. }  \n~\n\\mathcal{\\hat{Q}}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{\\hat{Q}} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{B \\times B} \\mid \\mathbf{\\hat{Q}} \\mathbf{1}_B=\\frac{1}{B} \\mathbf{1}_B, \\mathbf{\\hat{Q}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_B= \\frac{1}{B} \\mathbf{1}_B \\right\\},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the transport assignment $\\mathbf{\\hat{Q}}$ attempts to realign the clips with similar captions (\\ie, faulty negatives). After implementing the Sinkhorn algorithm described in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:q_ot}), we utilize the clip-wise realigned targets $\\hat{\\mathbf{Q}}^*$ as additional supervision for contrastive learning,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\resizebox{1\\linewidth}{!}{$\n  \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{clip}} = -\n\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^B\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^B\n[\\mathbf{T}]_{i,j}\n\\left(\n \\log \\frac{\n  \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{[\\hat{S}]}_{i,j} / \\tau\\right)}\n  {\n  \\sum_{k=1}^B \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{[\\hat{S}]}_{i,k}/ \\tau\\right)}\n +\n \\log \\frac{\n  \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{[\\hat{S}]}_{i,j} / \\tau\\right)}\n  {\n  \\sum_{k=1}^B \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{[\\hat{S}]}_{k,j}/ \\tau\\right)}\n  \\right)\n,  \\mathbf{T} = \\left(1-\\beta\\right) \\mathbf{I}_{B} \n + \\beta \\hat{\\mathbf{Q}}^*,\n$}\n  \\end{aligned}\n\\label{eq:lossclip}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\beta$ is a weighted parameter that balances the identity target $\\mathbf{I}_{B}$ and realigned targets $\\mathbf{\\hat{Q}}^*$. By replacing identity matrix $\\mathbf{I}_B$ with estimated soft-alignment probabilities, the model can recalibrate the attractive and repulsive forces between clips and captions. Specifically, the entire training batch is treated as a support set~\\citep{supportset} with a subset of relevant clips and captions. Our method enables the detection and correction of potential faulty negatives within the set.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.55\\linewidth}\n    {\n     \\centering\n        \\caption{Video-paragraph retrieval on YouCookII (\\textit{Background Removed}). \n        The best and second-best results are \\textbf{bold} and \\underline{underlined}, respectively.}\n\\tablestyle{3pt}{1.05}\n            \\label{tab:youcookfull}\n        {\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\shline\nApproach & Measure & R@1 & R@5 & R@10 \\\\\n\\hline \n MIL-NCE~\\citep{milnce} & Cap.

For comprehensive training details, training efficiency results, and additional experiments please refer to the Appendix.\n\n\\subsection{Comparisons on Video-paragraph Retrieval}\n\\label{sec:4.1}\n\nAs the main contribution of this work lies in long-term temporal learning, we first evaluate our method on the video-paragraph retrieval task. The objective of this task is to accurately find the corresponding video using a set of sentence queries that describe different parts of the long video.\n\n\\paragraph{Setup and Metric.} \nWe evaluate the zero-shot performance of our method in two different settings, namely, \\textit{Background Removed} and \\textit{Background Kept}. \nThe former setting discards the text-uncorrelated video clips based on the timestamps, while the latter uses the full video. As timestamps may not always be available, paragraph retrieval with background is a more realistic scenario.\nTo provide a comprehensive evaluation, we employ three standard strategies, namely,  \\mbox{Cap. Avg.} (Caption Average), DTW, and OTAM (Ordered Temporal Alignment Module~\\citep{otam}). Specifically, \\mbox{Cap. Avg.} matches one clip for each caption and retrieves the video with the most matched clips. DTW and OTAM calculate the sequence distance by accumulating the clip-caption distance based on chronological order. We report recall metrics R@1, R@5, and R@10 for all setups.\nSpecifically, R@1 indicates how often the correct prediction is the first result, which is highly desirable in many applications, while R@10 provides a wider scope and may be less critical as users typically focus on the top few results in practical scenarios.\n\n\\paragraph{Datasets.} We conduct the evaluation on YouCookII~\\citep{youcook} where the testing data consists of 436 videos with 3,350 clip-caption pairs in total. The videos existing in YouCookII have been removed from Howto100M~\\citep{howto100m} following the same protocol as previous works~\\citep{milnce,videoclip,tempclr}. \n\n \\paragraph{Results.} \ni) \\textit{Background Removed}:\nAs shown in Table~\\ref{tab:youcookfull}, TempCLR~\\citep{tempclr} performs remarkably better than VideoCLIP~\\citep{videoclip} in terms of DTW and OTAM, as it is trained to explore the global temporal context. However, all these methods suffer from noisy correspondence in the temporal alignment.\nIn contrast, our proposed robust optimal transport framework explicitly overcomes multi-granularity noisy correspondence. \nSpecifically, our method effectively improves the performance of all measurements by a large margin (+ 1\\% \\mbox{Cap. Avg.}, 5.2\\% DTW, and 4\\% OTAM in terms of R@1), indicating that our method learns better temporal information.\nii) \\textit{Background Kept}:\nAs shown in Table~\\ref{tab:youcookfullbg}, compared with the \\textit{Background Removed} results, the recall of all methods dropped as the irrelevant information in the background can distract the video features. Nevertheless, our proposed method consistently outperformed VideoCLIP and TempCLR, even under such challenging conditions.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation on Diverse Downstream tasks}\nTo verify the generalization of our method, we conduct experiments on three downstream tasks with four datasets described below. \n\n\\paragraph{Text-to-Video retrieval (clip level).} This task aims to find a corresponding video clip given a query caption. We use YouCookII~\\citep{youcook} and MSR-VTT~\\citep{msrvtt} to evaluate the transferability of our method. MSR-VTT~\\citep{msrvtt} is a well-known retrieval benchmark containing 10,000 short videos with 20 captions each. Following~\\cite{videoclip}, we utilize the 1,000 clip-caption test pairs for evaluation. For YouCookII, we use 3,350 clip-caption pairs as introduced in Section~\\ref{sec:4.1}. \n\nAs shown in Table~\\ref{tab:youcook}, our method achieves remarkable improvement over state-of-the-art methods on YouCookII. On MSR-VTT (Table~\\ref{tab:msrvtt}), our method shows solid improvements especially about 1.9\\% R@5 and 1.6\\% R@10 zero-shot improvement compared with VideoCLIP. After fine-tuning, our method still reaches state-of-the-art R@1.

The comparison demonstrates that our strategy outperforms~\\cite{yao2021filip}, supporting our claim that focusing on more crucial words/frames yields better fine-grained measurements in video understanding. When the weight $\\alpha$ tends towards 0, the log-sum-exp approximation approximates the maximum, resulting in the selection of the most relevant words/frames.

To address this, we propose Norton, a noise robust temporal optimal transport to estimate the sequence distance that can be easily extended and scaled to larger datasets with minimal computational cost.\nNotably, our unified optimal transport solution resolves the noisy correspondence problem at both frame-word and clip-caption levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only captures long-term temporal dependencies but also facilitates clip-level representation learning.\nIn the future, we plan to extend our method to address noisy correspondence for more modalities as videos typically include visual, textual, and audio content. \n\n\\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThis work was supported in part by NSFC under Grant U21B2040, 62176171; and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant CJ202303.\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 3>\n\nYour summary should follow these steps:\n- Title: Clearly state the main subject or topic of the summary.\n- Introduction: Describe the field and briefly introduce its history.

This field aims to establish a robust connection between the visual content of videos and their associated textual descriptions, often derived from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. The goal is to enable models to accurately predict the alignment of text segments to video segments, which can be used for various downstream tasks such as text-video retrieval, action segmentation, and video representation learning. Historically, joint visual-textual learning has been studied extensively, with methods like CLIP~\\cite{Radford21} and ALIGN~\\cite{Jia21} demonstrating strong performance in aligning images and captions. However, the video domain introduces additional challenges due to the temporal nature of the content, including issues of misalignment, asynchronous narration, and the presence of noise in the ASR-generated text. These challenges necessitate the development of specialized models and training strategies to handle the complexities inherent in long-term video understanding.\n\nCurrent progress in this field includes the use of large-scale datasets like HowTo100M~\\cite{Miech19}, which contain instructional videos with associated text transcripts. Despite the availability of such datasets, the alignment problem remains a significant challenge due to the unreliability of ASR-generated timestamps and the combinatorial complexity of the text content. The text may describe actions before or after they are performed, or it may include unrelated information, making it difficult to establish a clear temporal alignment. Additionally, the continuous nature of actions in videos complicates the definition of start and end points for temporal intervals.\n\nThe main objective of this summary is to provide an overview of recent advances in temporal alignment networks for long-term video understanding, highlighting the contributions, methodologies, and results of three key papers. These papers introduce novel approaches to address the alignment problem, each with unique contributions and methodologies. The first paper introduces TAN (Temporal Alignment Network)~\\cite{han2022temporal}, the second proposes TempCLR (Temporal Alignment Representation with Contrastive Learning)~\\cite{tempclr}, and the third introduces Norton (NOise Robust Temporal Optimal traNsport)~\\cite{norton}. Each paper tackles the alignment problem with different strategies, from co-training methods to contrastive learning frameworks and optimal transport approaches, and demonstrates significant improvements over existing baselines.\n\n#### Main Content of Each Paper\n\n**Paper 1: Temporal Alignment Networks (TAN) for Long-term Video**\n\nThis paper introduces TAN, a network designed to ingest long-term video sequences and associated text sentences to determine their alignment. The authors address the challenge of training such networks on large-scale datasets like HowTo100M, which contain significant noise and weakly aligned text. TAN is composed of a visual-textual backbone, a multimodal Transformer, and an alignability prediction module. The visual-textual backbone extracts features from videos and sentences using pre-trained networks, while the multimodal Transformer processes these features jointly to establish visual-textual correspondence. The alignability prediction module infers whether a sentence is alignable with the video and outputs an alignability score.\n\nThe authors propose a co-training method involving a dual encoder to denoise and train on raw instructional videos without manual annotation. The dual encoder processes visual and textual features independently, enabling it to identify unalignable sentences easily. The mutual agreement between TAN and the dual encoder is used for co-training, allowing the model to gradually improve its performance by training on cleaner data. They manually curate an 80-video subset of HowTo100M, named HTM-Align, to evaluate the alignment performance. TAN achieves state-of-the-art results on the HTM-Align dataset, outperforming strong baselines like CLIP and MIL-NCE. Additionally, TAN shows improved performance on downstream tasks such as text-video retrieval on YouCook2 and weakly supervised video action segmentation on Breakfast-Action.\n\n**Paper 2: Temporal Alignment Representation with Contrastive Learning (TempCLR)**\n\nTempCLR proposes a contrastive learning framework to explore temporal dynamics in video-paragraph pre-training. The authors argue that existing methods often ignore global temporal context, leading to suboptimal results. TempCLR addresses this by explicitly comparing the full video and the paragraph, using dynamic time warping (DTW) to compute the minimum cumulative cost over sentence-clip pairs as the sequence-level distance. To handle noisy correspondence, TempCLR breaks the temporal succession of video clips by shuffling them according to different granularities, ensuring that the model learns representations that perceive temporal information accurately. This approach is more efficient than directly modeling long videos, as it only requires the model to learn from short clips and sentences.\n\nThe authors introduce a negative sampling strategy based on shuffling video clips and captions to generate faulty negatives, which are then used to improve the clip-wise representation. TempCLR achieves consistent performance gains over existing methods on video retrieval, action step localization, and few-shot action recognition tasks. The method is evaluated on datasets like YouCook2 and CrossTask, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both zero-shot and finetuned settings.\n\n**Paper 3: Multi-granularity Correspondence Learning from Long-term Noisy Videos (Norton)**\n\nNorton addresses the multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) problem in temporal learning, which includes both coarse-grained asynchronous and irrelevant misalignments, as well as fine-grained frame-word misalignments. Norton proposes a unified optimal transport (OT) framework to measure sequence distances between video clips and captions robustly. The framework incorporates a soft-maximum operator for fine-grained alignment and an alignable prompt bucket (APB) to filter out semantic irrelevant clips and captions. This allows the model to focus on more crucial words and frames, improving the accuracy of alignment.\n\nNorton also exploits faulty negatives through OT by generating negative samples from the positive sequence and using these samples to recalibrate the model's predictions. The method is evaluated on various downstream tasks, including video retrieval, videoQA, and action segmentation, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods like VideoCLIP and TempCLR. The authors conduct extensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of their design choices, showing that their approach not only captures long-term temporal dependencies but also facilitates clip-level representation learning.\n\n#### Commonalities and Innovations\nAll three papers address the challenge of temporal alignment in long-form video understanding, with a focus on instructional videos and their associated text transcripts. They share the common goal of improving the alignment accuracy and robustness in the presence of noise and misalignment. However, each paper introduces unique methodologies and contributions:\n\n- **TAN** introduces a co-training method involving a dual encoder to denoise and train on raw instructional videos. This approach leverages the mutual agreement between two networks to improve alignment accuracy.\n- **TempCLR** proposes a contrastive learning framework that explicitly compares the full video and paragraph sequences using DTW to capture global temporal dynamics. The method shuffles video clips and captions to generate faulty negatives, which are used to improve the model's representation learning.\n- **Norton** addresses the multi-granularity noisy correspondence problem using a unified OT framework. It incorporates a soft-maximum operator for fine-grained alignment and an APB to filter out irrelevant content, ensuring that the model focuses on more crucial words and frames.\n\n#### Comparison of Results\nThe results of the three papers are compared across various datasets and tasks, including video retrieval, action step localization, and few-shot action recognition. The following table summarizes the performance of each method on these tasks:\n\n| Method | Dataset | Task | R@1 | R@5 | R@10 |\n|--------|---------|------|-----|------|------|\n| TAN    | HTM-Align | Alignment | 45.8 | 72.6 | 82.2 |\n| TempCLR | YouCook2 | Retrieval | 23.3 | 51.0 | 64.5 |\n| Norton | YouCookII | Retrieval | 24.2 | 51.9 | 64.1 |\n| TAN    | YouCook2 | Retrieval | 20.1 | 45.5 | 59.5 |\n| TempCLR | CrossTask | Localization | 36.9 | - | - |\n| Norton | CrossTask | Localization | 31.6 | - | - |\n| TAN    | Breakfast-Action | Segmentation | 68.3 | 51.7 | 69.3 |\n| TempCLR | COIN | Segmentation | 68.7 | 98.6 | 94.7 |\n| Norton | COIN | Segmentation | 69.8 | 98.8 | 95.0 |\n\n- **TAN** achieves the highest alignment accuracy on the HTM-Align dataset, surpassing other methods like CLIP and MIL-NCE.\n- **TempCLR** shows strong performance in video retrieval on YouCook2, especially in the zero-shot setting.\n- **Norton** outperforms existing methods in video retrieval on YouCookII, both in zero-shot and finetuned settings, indicating its robustness to noisy correspondence.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe three papers contribute significantly to the field of temporal alignment in long-term video understanding, each addressing the alignment problem with unique methodologies. TAN introduces a co-training approach with a dual encoder to denoise and improve alignment accuracy. TempCLR proposes a contrastive learning framework that explicitly compares full video and paragraph sequences, capturing global temporal dynamics. Norton addresses the multi-granularity noisy correspondence problem using a unified OT framework, which incorporates a soft-maximum operator and an APB to improve fine-grained alignment and filter out irrelevant content.\n\nThese advancements demonstrate the importance of considering temporal dynamics in video understanding and the potential of using large-scale instructional video datasets for representation learning. Future research directions could include extending these methods to handle more modalities, such as audio, and applying them to larger and more diverse datasets. Additionally, further exploration of the alignment problem in real-world applications, such as AI-assistants and video summarization, could provide valuable insights and practical benefits."
