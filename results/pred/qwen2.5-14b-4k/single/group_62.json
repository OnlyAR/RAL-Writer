Existing algorithms bypass such trade-off by a multi-stage training process: pre-training on imbalanced set and fine-tuning on balanced set. Though achieving promising performance, not only are they sensitive to the generalizability of the pre-trained model, but also not easily integrated into other computer vision tasks like detection and segmentation, where pre-training of classifiers solely is not applicable. In this paper, we propose a one-stage long-tailed recognition scheme,  ally complementary experts (ACE), where the expert is the most knowledgeable specialist in a sub-set that dominates its training, and is complementary to other experts in the less-seen categories without being disturbed by what it has never seen. We design a distribution-adaptive optimizer to adjust the learning pace of each expert to avoid over-fitting. Without special bells and whistles, the vanilla ACE outperforms the current one-stage SOTA method by 3$\\sim$ 10$\\%$ on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist datasets. It is also shown to be the first one to break the ``seesaw'' trade-off by improving the accuracy of the majority and minority categories simultaneously in only one stage. Code and trained models are at \\url{https://github.com/jrcai/ACE}. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./related-works.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n   \\caption{Performance of representative long-tailed recognition methods in terms of majority and minority classes compared to the baseline model (a ResNet). The results indicate most re-balancing methods improve the performance of minority categories by sacrificing that of the majority even with two-stage training (quadrant IV). Data augmentations are effective on the heads but slightly hurt the tails (quadrant II). The proposed ACE is the first one-stage SOTA method that improves the majority and minority simultaneously. Statistics for this figure are listed in the supplementary materials.}\n\\label{fig:related_works}\n\\end{figure}\n\nObject recognition is one of the most essential and substantial applications in computer vision. However, the performances of the state-of-the-art object recognition methods have limited capability on classifying real-world entities, which are skewed-distributed in a long-tailed manner naturally. Mostly driven by artificially-balanced datasets \\cite{ deng2009imagenet,krizhevsky2009learning}, current models are dominated by the sample-rich classes and lose sight of the tails when adapting to long-tailed sets. Facing up to the reality, scarce as the tail categories are, they are of the same or even higher significance than the heads in various fields, such as biological species identification \\cite{van2018inaturalist}, disease classification \\cite{wang2020imbalance} and web-spam message detection \\cite{zhao2020heterogeneous}. This long-lasting bottleneck significantly restricts classification-related computer vision tasks into practical use, including detection \\cite{tan2020equalization, wu2020forest, yu2021towards} and instance segmentation \\cite{wang2020devil, zang2021fasa}.\n\nTo ensure a well-accepted recognition capability over all categories, a tail-sensitive classifier becomes necessary. Existing solutions fall in three categories: one-stage \\cite{Huang_2016_CVPR, wang2017learning}, two-stage with pre-training\\cite{kang2019decoupling, cao2019learning}, and multi-stage multi-expert frameworks \\cite{xiang2020learning, wang2020long}. The one-stage algorithms follow a straightforward idea to addressed the imbalance of training set by re-balancing, including re-sampling \\cite{kang2019decoupling} and re-weighting \\cite{cao2019learning, cui2019class, zhang2017range}. Despite the promotion of the tails, balancing techniques show an obvious ``seesaw'' phenomenon (Figure~\\ref{fig:related_works}), that the accuracy of majority classes is sacrificed, indicating the under-representation of the heads. This raises a new concern that reducing the heads' accuracy might lead to more serious consequences. Taking the animal identification system as an example, some species are much richer in population than the endangered ones. Increasing the recognition accuracy of the snow leopards has little chance to be verified as they are rarely seen; on the contrary, failing to precisely classify two bird kinds can easily result in a misunderstanding of the local ecology. \n\nLiterature in the recent years \\cite{kang2019decoupling, wang2020long, xiang2020learning, zhang2021bag} handles the issue in a roundabout way: firstly train the feature extractor (backbone) with the whole imbalanced set for generalizable representation learning, then re-adjust the classifier by re-sampled data or build diverse experts for various tasks in cascading stages. Further improving the performance as they are, however, the general idea still holds old wine in a new bottle by making new trade-offs. To re-balance the data distribution, heavily relying on the well-adjusted pre-trained model and re-balancing skills make the frameworks sensitive to hyper-parameters and hard to find a sweet point. More importantly, the accumulated training steps make the multi-stage models redundant and less practical to be integrated with other tasks simultaneously, \\eg, detection \\cite{wang2020devil} and segmentation \\cite{zang2021fasa}. To guarantee the plug-in and play property, it is thus highly desirable to have a classifier that overcomes the long-tail challenge with only one stage.\n\nThe hankerings of overcoming current long-tail challenges make us look more profoundly to the human intelligence. When human-beings make hard classification choices, saying diagnosis of diseases, it is advantageous to involve specialistsâ€™ insights who are well-aware of their own fields. Moreover, for the rare diseases, panel discussion and consultation are indispensable to exclude interfering potentials. Similarly, in the long-tailed issue, we are inspired to design a group of experts with \\textit{complementary} skills: (1) they share elementary knowledge from the most diverse data source; (2) they are professional at splits of data respectively, and aware of what they do not specialize in; (3) opinions from the experienced experts (who see more data) are incorporated to complement the judgment from junior experts (who see less) for optimal decision.\n\nFollowing the idea, we propose the Ally Complementary Experts (ACE) for one-stage long-tailed recognition. ACE is a multi-expert structure where experts are trained in parallel with a shared backbone. The experts are assigned with diverse but overlapping imbalanced subsets, to benefit from specialization in the dominating part. We also introduce a distribution-adaptive optimizer that controls the update of each expert according to the volume of its training set. Finally, the outputs of all experts are re-scaled and aggregated by data splits. ACE is trained end-to-end without any pre-training or staged-training.\n\nWe evaluate ACE on various widely-used long-tailed datasets, including CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT \\cite{cui2019class}, ImageNet-LT \\cite{liu2019large} and iNaturalist2018 \\cite{van2018inaturalist} extensively with various experimental settings. Our method becomes the new SOTA among all one-stage long-tailed recognition methods with by 3-10$\\%$ accuracy gain and is the first one that improves performance on all the three frequency groups (many-shot, medium-shot and few-shot). ACE also surpasses several multi-stage methods \\cite{kang2019decoupling, kim2020m2m, liu2019large, xiang2020learning} by a large margin.\n\n\\section{Related Works}\n\\label{Related Works}\nMethods for long-tailed recognition can be mainly grouped into three types: (1) readjustment of the data distribution; (2) two-stage training and transfer learning; (3) multi-expert/branch frameworks. \n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\small\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}\n\\toprule[1.5pt]\nMethod &  Data for Experts& Relationship of Experts & \\makecell{Number of \\\\ Training Stages} & \\makecell{Majority \\\\Gain}& \\makecell{Minority \\\\ Gain} \\\\\\hline\\hline\\xrowht[()]{6pt}\n LFME \\cite{xiang2020learning} &  non-overlapping splits & independent & 2 & + & +\\\\ \\hline\\xrowht[()]{6pt}\n RIDE \\cite{wang2020long}&  same full set & competing and complementary & 3 & ++ & +\\\\\\hline\\xrowht[()]{6pt}\n\\textbf{\\textbf{ACE (Ours)}}& overlapping splits &  supportive and complementary & 1 & + & ++\\\\\n\\bottomrule[1.5pt]\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Comparisons between the proposed method with two SOTA multi-expert networks.}\n\\label{tab:related_works}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\subsection{On the Data: Re-balancing and Augmentations}\n\\label{sec:rebalancing}\nRe-balancing consists of under-sampling of the head classes, over-sampling of the tail classes and re-weighting of the loss function by the frequency or importance of the samples \\cite{japkowicz2002class, lin2017focal, cui2019class, cao2019learning}. Naive re-sampling in a class-balanced manner \\cite{Huang_2016_CVPR,wang2017learning} can easily overfit on the sample-few classes, either constructing a less imbalanced distribution by square-root sampling \\cite{mikolov2013distributed} or adjusting from instance-balanced to class-balanced sampling progressively \\cite{cao2019learning, cui2019class, zhou2020bbn} is a more stable and promising alternative. \n\nBesides, strong data augmentations, which compensate for the insufficiency of data and improves the model's generalizability, could increase the diversity of the training set. Mixup \\cite{zhang2017mixup} along with its long-tailed variant re-balanced Mix-up (ReMix) \\cite{chou2020remix}; and tail classes synthesis \\cite{zhang2021bag} are representative methods. However, the above algorithms commonly sacrifice the tails for the heads, or vice versa (Figure~\\ref{fig:related_works}). The reason is the contradiction between representation learning and classifier learning, \\ie, instanced-based (bias) sampling learns the most generalizable representations while the unbiased classifier is less likely to overfit the re-sampled set.\n\n\\subsection{On the Representation: Two-stage Training and Transfer Learning} \nThe methods in the second category migrate the learned knowledge from the heads to tails by two-stage training or memory-based transfer learning. Deferred re-balancing by re-sampling (DRS) and re-weighting (DRW) scheme \\cite{cao2019learning} train the classifier layers with re-balancing after obtaining good representation on the imbalanced set at the first stage. Kang \\etal \\cite{kang2019decoupling} propose $\\tau$-norm and learnable weight scaling (LWS) to re-balance the decision boundaries of classifiers in the parameter domain. OLTR \\cite{liu2019large} and inflated episodic memory (IEM) \\cite{zhu2020inflated} utilize memory banks for prototype learning and knowledge transfer among classes. However, the use of re-balancing can still hurt the accuracy of heads, and the inevitable extra memory consumption potentially limits the deployment on large-scale datasets.\n\n\\subsection{Ensemble Methods: Multi-expert Networks} \nThe recent trend on multi-expert or multi-branch networks shows the strong potential to address the long-tailed issue by treating the relatively balanced sub-groups separately. BBN \\cite{zhou2020bbn}, which assigns two branches with normal and reversed sampling, respectively, incooperates a cumulative learning strategy to adjust the bilateral training. BBN merges the two-stage methods into one, but still suffers from the same drawbacks of slight degradation of headâ€™s accuracy. LFME \\cite{xiang2020learning} and RIDE \\cite{wang2020long} are multi-expert architectures that learn diverse classifiers in parallel, combining with knowledge distillation and distribution-aware expert selection. The main difference between our proposal and these two state-of-the-art methods are summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:related_works}. Though achieving impressive performance, both of them suffer from extensive hyper-parameter tuning to balance the multiple optimization functions. More importantly, the multi-stage training requirement makes them difficult to be integrated into other tasks, like detection and segmentation.\n\n\\section{Proposed Methodology}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./new_workflow.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n   \\caption{Network architecture of ACE. There are four components: (1) a shared backbone for representation learning; (2) a distribution-aware planner assigns diverse target categories (TC) and interfering categories to each expert, respectively; (3) a group of experts that learns to identify the TC with classification loss $L_{cls}$ and eliminate their effect on IC with complementary loss $L_{com}$; (4) a distribution-adaptive loss that adjust learning pace $\\eta$ of each expert for simultaneous convergence. By allying complementary experts (ACE) in a group average manner, the aggregated prediction compromises the merits of all experts.}\n\\label{fig:ACE}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsection{The ACE Framework}\nThe architecture of the proposed Ally Complementary Experts (ACE) network is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:ACE}. \nFollowed a shared backbone, multiple experts are branched out with individual learnable blocks and a prediction layer. A distribution-aware planner distributes diverse but overlapping category splits for each expert, including target categories (TC) and interfering categories (IC). These experts complement each other from three aspects: (1) the dominating categories in their TCs are different, so that the predictions have their own strengths; (2) the TCs are overlapping, especially on sample-few categories, thus the predictions support each other; (3) the experts learn to suppress the output of IC so that they will not bring ambiguity in the categories that have never been seen. To further accommodate the disparity in data, a distribution-adaptive optimizer is designed to guide the experts to update at their own paces. We use classification loss $L_{cls}$ and complement loss $L_{com}$ to train the model end-to-end in only one-shot. Finally, the predictions from the experts are aggregated by averaging over the re-scaled logits in each data split.\n\n\\subsection{Distribution-aware Planner}\nThe experimental fact that classifiers tend to have better performance on the majority categories than the minority on an imbalanced set is considered a drawback and avoided by existing methods. However, if each splitâ€™s prediction is obtained from a classifier that biases on it, we could expect accuracy gains everywhere. Therefore, we design a distribution-aware planner to assign each expert with a subset of the training set, which is also imbalanced and dominated by different splits, respectively. Formally, the process is as follows,\n\nGiven a training set $\\mathbb{D}=\\{X;Y\\}$, where $X$ denotes the data and $Y$ denotes the corresponding class labels, with $C$ categories in total, for $K$ experts $\\mathbb{E}=\\{\\mathcal{E}_1, \\mathcal{E}_2, ..., \\mathcal{E}_K\\}$. Each $\\mathcal{E}_i$ is assigned subset categories $\\mathcal{C}_i$, where $C$ is assumed to be a multiple of $K$ for simplicity of discussion and without loss of generality, $|\\mathcal{C}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{C}_2 \\cup ... \\cup \\mathcal{C}_K|=C$ and $\\mathcal{C}_i \\cap \\mathcal{C}_j \\neq \\varnothing$. \n\nSimilar to the spirit of re-balancing, sample-few categories should be more exposed. Therefore, the $i$-th expert $\\mathcal{E}_i$ is assigned target $\\mathcal{C}_i $ and interfering classes $\\widetilde {\\mathcal{C}_i}$\n\\begin{equation}\n     \\begin{aligned}\n        \\mathcal{C}_i &=\\{\\frac{C}{K}(i-1)+1,\\frac{C}{K}(i-1)+2, \\frac{C}{K}(i-1)+3, ..., C \\}, \\\\ \n        \\widetilde {\\mathcal{C}_i} &=\\{1, 2, ...,\\frac{C}{K}(i-1)\\}.   \n    \\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\nFor a randomly-sampled mini-batch of training data $\\mathcal{B} \\subset \\mathbb{D}$, $\\mathcal{E}_i$ uses the corresponding sub-batch $\\mathcal{B}_i=\\{(x,y): (x,y) \\in \\mathcal{B}, y \\in \\mathcal{C}_i\\}$. In this case, there is always an expert be presented for training with all the samples, and the smaller the class, the more experts are presented. Besides, with this data split mechanism, the medium-shot or few-shot classes have chances to dominate an expert, thus eliminating the bias towards the sample-rich classes. The network degenerates to a plain classifier if $K=1$. \n\nSimilar to the existing methods, we use the ResNet \\cite{he2016deep} as our backbone. The last residual block is duplicated for each expert, and followed by a learnable weight scaling (LWS) classifier \\cite{kang2019decoupling}. The output logits (before SoftMax) of $\\mathcal{E}_i$ is $\\textbf{z}^{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1\\times|C|}$, which are fyrther adjusted to be $\\hat{\\textbf{z}_i}$ by the norm of the fully-connected layers' weights to have comparable scales: \n\\begin{equation}\n     \\hat{\\textbf{z}_i} = \\frac{\\|\\textbf{w}_i\\|^2}{\\|\\textbf{w}_1\\|^2} \\cdot \\textbf{z}_i \n\\end{equation}\n\nThe set of experts that trained with class $c$ is $\\mathcal{S}^c$, then the output logit of class $c$ is the average among the outputs from $\\mathcal{S}^c$, \\ie, \n\\begin{equation}\n     \\textbf{o}^c = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{S}_c|} \\sum_{\\mathcal{E}_i \\in \\mathcal{S}^c}\\hat{\\textbf{z}_i}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSoftMax operation is applied on $\\textbf{o}$ to obtain the classification confidence.\n\n\\subsection{Objective Functions}\nLoss functions are applied on each expert separately instead of on the aggregated output $\\textbf{o}$ to avoid a mixture of expect-specific features. We use the cross-entropy loss as the classification loss, with the sub-batch $\\mathcal{B}_i$ for $\\mathcal{E}_i$,\n\\begin{equation}\n    L_{cls}^i(\\mathcal{B}_i)=-\\sum ^{\\mathcal{C}_i}y\\log(\\sigma(\\textbf{z}_i)), \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\sigma (\\cdot)$ represents the SoftMax operation.\n\nIn addition to classifying the assigned targeted class, each experttâ€™s response should not affect the other experts on the classes they have never seen, \\ie, the interfering categories (IC). For the experts themselves, categories in IC are the main source of confusion as well. By eliminating the effect of IC, the experts work in a complementary manner rather than competitive. Hence, a regularization term to suppress the output of IC is necessary. We define the complement loss $L_{com}$ as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L_{com}^i(\\mathcal{B}_i)=\\sum ^{\\mathcal{C}}_{c_j \\in \\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}_i}} \\|\\textbf{z}_i^{c_j}\\|^2.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe complement loss, which serves as a soft regularization in the optimization process, minimizes the logits of non-target categories for $\\mathcal{E}_i$ so as to put down their effect. Detailed study of the impact of incorporating $L_{com}$ could be found in Sec~\\ref{abs}.\n\nOverall, the loss function for $\\mathcal{E}_i$ is\n\\begin{equation}\n    L_{\\mathcal{E}_i}(\\mathcal{B}_i)= L_{cls}^i + L_{com}^i.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Distributed-adaptive Optimizer}\nRecall the Linear Scaling Rule \\cite{goyal2017accurate} for training networks in mini-batches with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer: \\textit{when the minibatch size is multiplied by k, multiply the learning rate by k. All other hyper-parameters (weight decay, momentum, \\etc) are kept unchanged}. \n\nBy this rule, to avoid over-fitting, the optimizer should be distribution-aware to assign smaller weights to $\\mathcal{E}_i$ which is trained with less data. Denoted the base learning rate as $\\eta_0$, which is the learning rate for the expert presented with all categories, the $i$-th expert is trained by,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\eta_i = \\eta_0 \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}_i} {n_c}}{\\sum^{\\mathcal{C}} {n_j}},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}=\\{n_1, n_2,... n_{C}\\}$ are the number of samples in each class and $\\mathcal{N}$ is assumed in the descending order. \n\nThe loss of $\\mathcal{E}_1$ updates the backbone and parameters of $\\mathcal{E}_1$, and $L_{i}$ that $i>1$ only updates the expert itself. The reason is the errors likely duplicates because of data overlapping, which means the backbone could be corrected multiple times due to the same error. This is similar to the idea of re-weighting methods, as introduced in Section~\\ref{sec:rebalancing} that hurt the representation learning. Therefore, only $\\mathcal{E}_1$ updates the backbone.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\subsection{Datasets and Protocols}\nGenerally, in long-tail recognition tasks, the classes are categorized into many (with more than 100 training samples), medium (with 20 $\\sim$100 samples) and few (with less than 20 samples) splits \\cite{liu2019large}. The \\textit{imbalance factors}(IFs) of the long-tailed datasets, defined as the frequency of the largest class divided by the smallest class, vary from 10 to over 500 \\cite{cui2019class, liu2019large, van2018inaturalist}.\n\n\\textbf{CIFAR100-LT and CIFAR10-LT} \\cite{cui2019class} are artificially created from the balanced CIFAR dataset \\cite{krizhevsky2009learning} by reducing training samples according to an exponential function $n = n_i \\mu^i$, where $i$ is the class index, $n_i$ is the original number of samples and $\\mu \\in (0,1)$. We experiment with two commonly used IFs, 100 and 50. There are approximately 10K$\\sim$13K training images and 10K testing images for each split. ResNet-32 is used as the base network, where the last residual block is tripled for the branches to be comparable with other methods. Following \\cite{he2016deep}, for training samples, 4 pixels are padded on each side, following by a $32 \\times 32$ random crop on the padded image or its horizontal flip. The network is trained by the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum 0.9 for 400 epochs. The base learning rate is 0.1 and decreases by 0.1 at epoch 320 and 360, respectively. Mixup \\cite{zhang2017mixup} augmentation is used with $\\alpha$ as 0.3, and the last 20 epochs are trained without Mixup.\n\n \\textbf{ImageNet-LT} \\cite{liu2019large} is sampled from ImageNet-2012 \\cite{deng2009imagenet} following the Pareto distribution with the power value $\\alpha=6$. ImageNet-LT contains 115.8K images for 1000 categories, with a maximum of 1280 images per class and a minimum of 5 images per class. Following \\cite{liu2019large, kang2019decoupling, xiang2020learning, zhang2021bag}, we use ResNet-10 as the backbone. To be comparable with \\cite{kang2019decoupling,wang2020long}, we also report our results with ResNet-50 and ResNeXt-50 \\cite{xie2017aggregated}. For data pre-processing, the training samples are resized to $256 \\times 256$, then randomly cropped to $224 \\times 224$ and flipped horizontally with a probability of 0.5; on testing, the aspect ratio of the testing sample is kept by first resizing proportionally its shorter side to 256 then crop $224 \\times 224$ in the center. The networks are trained by the SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9 for 100 epochs. The base learning rate is 0.1 and decreases by 0.1 at epoch 120 and 160. Mixup augmentation is used with $\\alpha$ as 0.3, and the last 20 epochs are trained without Mixup.\n \n\\textbf{iNaturalist2018} \\cite{van2018inaturalist} is a real-world large-scale dataset for species identification of animals and plants. Following the literature, we use the 2018 version which contains 438K images for over 8K categories, with extremely imbalanced distribution (IF=512) and challenging fine-grained issues. We use ResNet-50 as the backbone, and the same prepossessing and training protocol as ImageNet-LT. Mixup augmentation is used with $\\alpha$ as 0.3, and the last 20 epochs are trained without Mixup.\n\n\\subsection{Performance}\n\\textbf{Competing methods.} Generally, there are two types of the competing methods by whether or not there is a backbone pre-training stage. For one-stage type of methods, re-balancing of the long-tailed dataset is either by resampling, (\\eg, class-balanced and progressively-balanced \\cite{kang2019decoupling}), or reweighting (\\eg, focal loss \\cite{lin2017focal}, class-balanced focal loss \\cite{cui2019class}, and LDAM \\cite{cao2019learning}). Besides, strong augmentation tricks (\\eg, mixup \\cite{zhang2017mixup}, re-balanced mixup \\cite{chou2020remix}, tail sample synthesis using class activation maps (CAM) \\cite{zhang2021bag})) can also benefit the overall accuracy, especially the heads. Moreover, transfer learning in either image domain (major-to-minor translation \\cite{kim2020m2m}) and in feature domain (OLTR \\cite{liu2019large}) are proved useful. Logit Adjustment \\cite{menon2020long} encourages a large relative margin between logits of rare\nversus dominant labels with a one-stage loss. BBN \\cite{zhou2020bbn} uses a two-branch architecture to combine normal sampling and distribution-reversed sampling progressively, improving the tail's accuracy in a large margin. The other type is two-stage methods.

Our method outperforms the BBN by 6.4$\\%$ (ResNet-50) and  7.3$\\%$ (ResNeXt-50) on ImageNet-LT and 3.9$\\%$ on iNaturalist2018, respectively.\n\n\\subsection{How ACE Works}\n\\label{abs}\n\\textbf{Complementary of experts.} We compare ACE with its two variants to show the effectiveness of its architecture, learning process and the loss function: one is training without $L_{com}$ and the other is the non-complementary architecture, which is called split-specific classifier (SSC). In the latter one, output dimensions of the classifier of $\\mathcal{E}_i$ are the same as $|\\mathcal{C}_i|$, \\ie, $\\textbf{z}^{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1\\times|\\mathcal{C}_i|}$. In other words, the weights of non-target groups are set to be zero as a hard constraint, instead of learning to suppress them with $L_{com}$ in a soft regularization manner. The three architectures are shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:abl-comloss} and their results are in Table ~\\ref{tab:abs-lcom}. Figure~\\ref{fig:abl-comloss} shows ACE with $L_{com}$ in the top row, where $\\mathcal{E}_i$ learns similar scales over all the data splits and the scales of interfering classes are zeros. Therefore, all trained experts have an approximately equal contribution to the shared splits. We also observe that on the minority splits $j$ of $\\mathcal{E}_i$  generates supportive results for $\\mathcal{E}_j$ (\\eg, $\\mathcal{E}_1$ is peripheral in the few-shot split, and its scales are smaller than those of $\\mathcal{E}_3$, so it is just a supplementary to $\\mathcal{E}_3$'s output.). As seen from the middle row of Figure \\ref{fig:abl-comloss}, by splitting the data to complementary batches, but without $L_{com}$, all experts  compete with one anoother in the common splits. For example, $\\mathcal{E}_1$ is strong over all categories though it is less accurate in the minority classes compared to $\\mathcal{E}_3$, $\\mathcal{E}_1$'s scales are still larger than $\\mathcal{E}_3$'s. This explains why ACE without $L_{com}$ has the best performance in the head categories. In the experiments on SSC, where the experts learn to classify $\\mathcal{C}_i$ but cannot distinguish the untrained categories, resulting in the obvious dominance of the expert trained with the full set in all splits, making other experts useless. \n\nResults here are inspiring: different from most exiting works that try to eliminate the bias, we utilize it. The data re-balancing is embedded in the data assignment to ensure more exposure of the minority. The individual back-propagation of each expert will not hurt the representation learning. Therefore, $L_{com}$ decouples the representation learning and classifier training in one stage.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c c c}\n\\toprule[1.5pt]\n\\textbf{Methods} &  \\textbf{All} & \\textbf{Many} & \\textbf{Medium} & \\textbf{Few}\\\\\\hline\\hline\n \\textbf{ACE (With $L_{com}$)} &  \\textbf{49.4} & \\textbf{66.1} & \\textbf{55.7} & \\textbf{23.5}\\\\\n \\rowcolor{gray!10} Expert 1 & 41.9  & 71.2 & 40.2 & 10.7\\\\\n \\rowcolor{gray!10} Expert 2 &  30.7 & 19.9 & 53.7 & 17.7\\\\\n \\rowcolor{gray!10} Expert 3 &  21.8 & 0.0 & 38.7 & 27.8\\\\\\hline\n\\textbf{Without $L_{com}$} & \\textbf{47.2}& \\textbf{71.5} & \\textbf{49.4} &\\textbf{17.5}\\\\\n \\rowcolor{gray!10} Expert 1 &  42.0 & 71.0 & 40.9 & 10.5 \\\\\n \\rowcolor{gray!10} Expert 2 &  31.1 & 19.4 & 53.8 & 19.4\\\\\n \\rowcolor{gray!10} Expert 3 &  22.0 & 0.0 & 38.8 & 28.3\\\\\n \\textbf{With SSC} & \\textbf{43.4} & \\textbf{65.1} & \\textbf{44.4} & \\textbf{18.0}\\\\\n \\rowcolor{gray!10} Expert 1 &  41.6 & 68.2 & 41.2 & 12.1\\\\\n \\rowcolor{gray!10} Expert 2 &  16.0 & 2.4 & 26.5 & 19.9\\\\\n \\rowcolor{gray!10} Expert 3 &  21.4 &  0.0 & 38.6 & 26.7\\\\\n\\bottomrule[1.5pt]\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Overall and many-/medium-/few-shot split top-1 accuracy on CIFAR100-LT-100 of the three model.

In this section, we compare the linear scaling rule with the square-root scaling \\cite{krizhevsky2014one} and a uniform optimizer. \\cite{krizhevsky2014one} indicates when multiplying the batch size by $S$, one should multiply the learning rate by $\\sqrt S$ to keep the variance in the gradient expectation constant. For a uniform optimizer, all the experts share the same $\\eta$, \\ie,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        \\eta_i^{sqrt} = \\eta_0 \\cdot \\sqrt {\\frac{\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}_i} {n_c}}{\\sum^{\\mathcal{C}} {n_j}}},\n        \\eta_i^{uni} = \\eta_0\n    \\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe training will be more sensitive to the variance of data with a larger learning rate. For the experts trained by minority splits, we have $\\eta_i^{uni}>>\\eta_i^{sqrt}>\\eta_i^{linear}$. The comparison of the results is shown in Table~\\ref{tab:abs-lr}. All three schemes produce better results than baseline. $\\eta_i^{uni}$ promotes the higher improvements in the majority categories, while significantly decreases the tails. The reason is several experts converge too early and thus not effective due to over-fitting. $\\eta_i^{sqrt}$ and $\\eta_i^{linear}$ show similar performance, while $\\eta_i^{linear}$ is better in medium and few-shot splits. By comparing $\\eta_i^{sqrt}$ and $\\eta_i^{linear}$, we observe learning rate is not the principal reason for accuracy booms. We conclude that selecting a proper optimization scheme with respect to the data distribution can effectively benefit the overall performance.\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{./com_Lcom.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n   \\caption{The design and classifier weights/bias of three model: ACE trained with complementary loss (top), ACE trained without complementary loss (middle), and split-specific classifiers (SSC) (bottom) trained on CIFAR100-LT-100. $\\mathcal{E}_1$, $\\mathcal{E}_2$ and $\\mathcal{E}_3$ are plotted in red, blue and green colors, respectively.

Computing the maximum by groups over the scaled logits (2) also suppresses the performance on the heads, as the experts for small classes are easier to overfit and thus overconfident. Concatenating the result of each dominating group of the experts amplifies the drawbacks of overconfidence, and experts competes each other. Overall, merging multiple experts is a trade-off for one-stage methods, in which all experts are trained from scratch. On the other hand, our ACE balances them by adjusting learning speed and with complementary loss, achieving improvements for all groups. \n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c c c}\n\\toprule[1.5pt]\n\\textbf{Aggregation} &  \\textbf{All} & \\textbf{Many} & \\textbf{Medium} & \\textbf{Few}\\\\\\hline\\hline\nGroup Avg w/ scaling (ACE) &  49.4 & 66.1 & 55.7 & 23.5\\\\\nGroup Max (2) &  43.4 & 47.5 & 54.2 & 26.5 \\\\\nGroup Concat (3)   & 37.7 &  30.3 & 50.2 & 22.9 \\\\\nGroup Avg w/o scaling (4)  & 46.7 & 49.5  &53.0 & 36.5\\\\\n\\bottomrule[1.5pt]\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Ablation study on aggregation of the outputs on CIFAR100-LT-100.}\n\\label{tab:abs-agg}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{./ablation_output.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n   \\caption{Illustration of variants of output aggregation methods.}\n\\label{fig:abl-out}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\textbf{Effectiveness of data augmentation.} Mixup data augmentation is shown useful in previous studies \\cite{zhou2020bbn, chou2020remix, zhang2021bag}.

We proposed a multi-expert network that optimizes the two in a uniform network. Complementary constraints in data and objective function are applied to suppress the effects of non-targeted groups and promote both of the dominating and minority groups. Besides, a distribution-adaptive optimization scheme helps to adjust the learning paces of each expert to avoid over-fitting. ACE becomes the new SOTA among all one-stage long-tailed recognition methods with 3$\\sim$10$\\%$ accuracy gain, and is the first one that improves performance on all three frequency splits. With the equivalent strong performance to the multi-stage methods, there is great potential to extend well-formulated one-stage ACE to complex computer vision tasks like detection and segmentation.\n{\\small \\balance\n}\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 1>\n\n<paper 2>\n\\title{Targeted Supervised Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Recognition}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\title{Targeted Supervised Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Recognition}\n\n\\author{Tianhong Li$^{1,}$\\thanks{Indicates equal contribution.} \\quad Peng Cao$^{1,{\\ast}}$ \\quad Yuan Yuan$^1$ \\quad Lijie Fan$^1$ \\quad Yuzhe Yang$^1$ \\\\ \n\\quad Rogerio Feris$^2$ \\quad Piotr Indyk$^1$ \\quad Dina Katabi$^1$ \\\\\\\\ $^1$MIT CSAIL, $^2$MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab}\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\n\nReal-world data often exhibits long tail distributions with heavy class imbalance, where the majority classes can dominate the training process and alter the decision boundaries of the minority classes. Recently, researchers have investigated the potential of supervised contrastive learning for long-tailed recognition, and demonstrated that it provides a strong performance gain. In this paper, we show that while supervised contrastive learning can help improve performance, past baselines suffer from poor uniformity brought in by imbalanced data distribution. This poor uniformity manifests in samples from the minority class having poor separability in the feature space. To address this problem, we propose targeted supervised contrastive learning (\\name), which improves the uniformity of the feature distribution on the hypersphere. \\name\\ first generates a set of targets uniformly distributed on a hypersphere. It then makes the features of different classes converge to these distinct and uniformly distributed targets during training.  This forces all classes, including minority classes, to maintain a uniform distribution in the feature space, improves class boundaries, and provides better generalization even in the presence of long-tail data. Experiments on multiple datasets show that \\name~achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed recognition tasks.

For critical applications, such as medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, and fairness, the data are by their nature heavily imbalanced, and the minority classes are particularly important (minority classes can be patients or accidents~\\cite{shen2015long,yang2022multi,yang2021delving}). Interest in such problems has motivated much recent research on imbalanced classification, where the training dataset is imbalanced or long-tailed but the test dataset is equally distributed among classes~\\cite{kang2019decoupling,wang2020long,yang2020rethinking,cao2019learning,yang2022multi}. \n\nLong-tailed and imbalanced datasets pose major challenges for classification tasks leading to a significant performance drop~\\cite{ando2017deep, buda2018systematic, collobert2008unified, yang2019me, wu2020solving}. Techniques such as data re-sampling~\\cite{chawla2002smote, shen2016relay, buda2018systematic, ando2017deep} and  loss re-weighting~\\cite{cao2019learning, cui2019class, dong2018imbalanced, khan2019striking, khan2017cost, byrd2019effect} can improve the performance of tail classes but typically harm head classes \\cite{kang2019decoupling}.\nRecently, researchers have investigated the potential of supervised contrastive learning for long-tailed recognition, and demonstrated that it provides a strong performance gain~\\cite{kang2020exploring}. They further proposed $k$-positive contrastive learning (KCL), a variant of supervised contrastive learning that yields even better performance on long-tailed datasets.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{fig1} \n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-10pt}\n\\caption{\\small\nTest data feature distribution of (a) k-positive contrastive learning (KCL) and (b) \\name\\ for three classes of CIFAR10 (plane, cat, dog), for different training data imbalance ratios $\\rho$. With high imbalance ratio, class centers learned by KCL exhibit poor uniformity while class centers learned by \\name~are still uniformly distributed and thus \\name\\ achieves better performance (where Acc refers to Accuracy on test data).}\n\\label{fig:intro}\n\\vspace{-10pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\nHowever, while supervised contrastive learning can be beneficial, applying the contrastive loss (including the KCL loss) to imbalanced data can yield poor uniformity, which hampers performance. Uniformity is a desirable property~\\cite{wang2020long}; it refers to that in an ideal scenario supervised contrastive learning should converge to an embedding where the different classes are uniformly distributed on a hypersphere~\\cite{wang2020long,graf2021dissecting}. Uniformity maximizes the distance between classes in the feature space, i.e., maximizes the margin. As a result, it improves  generalizability. \n\nBut, when the classes are imbalanced, training naturally puts more weight on the loss of majority classes and less weight on that of minority classes. As a result, the classes are no longer uniformly distributed in the feature space. To illustrate this issue, we consider three classes from CIFAR-10: dog, cat, and plane. We train a KCL model~\\cite{kang2020exploring} on this data for different imbalance ratios, $\\rho$. For visualization clarity we use a 2D feature space. As seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:intro}(a), when the classes are balanced (i.e., $\\rho$=1:1:1), the centers of the three classes are uniformly distributed in the KCL feature space. In contrast, when the imbalance ratio is high  (e.g., $\\rho$=100:1:1), the classes with fewer training instances start to collapse into each other, leading to unclear and inseparable decision boundaries, and thus lower performance. This is because the imbalanced data distribution naturally puts more weight on the uniformity loss between the head class and the tail classes, and less weight on that between the two tail classes, making the distance between head and tail classes much larger than the distance between two tail classes. The more imbalanced the long-tailed data, the more biased and less uniformly distributed the feature space.\n\nOne may attempt to fix this problem by oversampling the tail classes or re-weighting the loss function. However,  as shown in~\\cite{kang2019decoupling}, those methods overfit tail classes and improve tail-class performance at the expense of head classes, and thus harm the quality of the learned features. \nTherefore, a method that performs instance-balanced sampling while still being able to learn a uniform feature space is needed. \n\nIn this paper, we propose targeted supervised contrastive learning (\\name) for long-tailed recognition. To avoid the feature space being dominated and biased by head classes, we generate the optimal locations of class centers in advance (i.e., off-line). We call these uniformly distributed points class targets. We then devise \n an online matching-training scheme that performs contrastive training while adaptively matching samples from each class to one of the targets. As shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:intro}(b), \\name~learns a class-balanced feature space regardless of the imbalance ratio of the training set.\n \nNote that one cannot simply match any target point with any class. Though the targets are uniformly distributed in the feature space, the distance between two targets can vary widely. For example, if the number of classes in Fig. \\ref{fig:intro} was 10 instead of 3, then though the targets are uniformly distributed, some targets will be closer to each other than the rest. Thus, our matching-training scheme has to ensure that classes that are semantically close (e.g., cat and dog)\nconverge to nearby targets, and classes that are semantically farther apart converge to relatively distant targets. \n\nWe evaluate \\name~on long-tailed benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist, and show that it improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances on all of them.\n \nTo summarize, this paper makes the following contributions:\n\\begin{Itemize}\n    \\item It introduces \\name, a novel framework for long-tailed recognition that avoids the feature space being dominated and biased by head classes.\n    \\item It empirically shows that supervised contrastive learning baselines can suffer from poor uniformity when applied to long-tailed recognition, which degrades their performances.\n    \\item It further shows that \\name~achieves SOTA long-tailed recognition performances on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\\end{Itemize}\n\n\\section{Related Works}\n\n\\textbf{Imbalanced Learning and Long-tailed Recognition.}\nReal-world data typically follows a long-tailed or imbalanced distribution, which biases the learning towards head classes, and degrades performance on tail classes~\\cite{yang2022multi, zhang2021deep}. Conventional methods have focused on designing class re-balancing paradigms through data re-sampling~\\cite{chawla2002smote, shen2016relay, buda2018systematic, ando2017deep} or adjusting the loss weights for different classes during training~\\cite{cao2019learning, cui2019class, dong2018imbalanced, khan2019striking, khan2017cost, byrd2019effect}. However, such methods improve tail class performance at the expense of head class performance~\\cite{kang2019decoupling}.\nResearchers have also tried to improve long-tailed recognition by using ensembles over different data distributions\\cite{zhou2020bbn, wang2020long,zhang2021test}, i.e., they re-organize long-tailed data into groups, train a model per group, and combine individual models in a multi-expert framework, or by using a distillation label generation module guided by self-supervision\\cite{li2021self}. Ensemble-based and distillation-based methods have been shown to be orthogonal to methods operating on a single model and could leverage improvements in single-model methods to improve the performance.\n\nRecent works~\\cite{kang2019decoupling,zhou2020bbn,yang2021delving} show that decoupling representation learning from classifier learning can lead to good features, which motivates the use of feature extractor pre-training for long-tailed recognition. The authors of~\\cite{yang2020rethinking} introduced a self-supervised pre-training initialization that alleviates the bias caused by imbalanced data. The authors of~\\cite{kang2020exploring} further show that self-supervised learning can improve robustness to data imbalance, and introduce k-positive contrastive learning (KCL). \nOur work builds on this literature, and introduces a new approach to dealing with data imbalance using pre-computed uniformly-distributed targets that guide the training process to achieve better uniformity and improved class boundaries. \n \n\n\\textbf{Contrastive Learning.}\nRecent years have witnessed a steady progress on self-supervised representation learning~\\cite{oord2018representation, doersch2015unsupervised,huang2017multi, noroozi2016unsupervised,fan2018end,fan2019controllable,fan2017adversarial,li2021self, fan2020learning,li2019making,fan2020home,zhao2018through,zhao2018rf}. Contrastive learning~\\cite{he2020momentum,chen2020simple, chen2021exploring, khosla2020supervised,fan2021does, wang2020understanding, li2020making, grill2020bootstrap} has been outstandingly successful on multiple tasks~\\cite{li2022rf, wu2021consistency, morgado2021robust}. The core idea of contrastive learning is to align the positive sample pairs and repulse the negative sample pairs. Many works~\\cite{wang2020understanding, tian2020makes, li2020making, tian2021understanding, graf2021dissecting} have made efforts to understand and explain its properties, as well as its effects on downstream tasks. \nIn particular, \\cite{wang2020understanding} proves that contrastive learning asymptotically optimizes both\nalignment (closeness) of features from positive pairs, and uniformity of the induced distribution of the (normalized) features on the hypersphere. \n Supervised contrastive learning (SupCon)~\\cite{khosla2020supervised} extends contrastive learning to the fully-supervised setting. It selects the positive samples from data belonging to the same class and aligns them in the embedding space, while simultaneously pushing away samples from different classes. By leveraging class labels with a contrastive loss, SupCon surpasses the performance  of the traditional supervised cross-entropy loss on image classification. Most work on contrastive learning focuses on balanced data. Recently however, researchers have applied contrastive learning to imbalanced and long-tailed classification and demonstrated improved performance\\cite{kang2020exploring,yang2020rethinking}. \n \n\\section{Method}\n\n\\name~is a training framework for improving the uniformity of the latent feature distribution. It aims to learn representations where the centers of each class are distributed uniformly on a hypersphere, and thus obtain clear decision boundaries between classes. \\name~is especially effective on long-tailed recognition tasks, since for traditional methods based on supervised contrastive loss, classes with fewer training instances could easily collapse with other tail classes, resulting in poor classification performance.\n\nFig. \\ref{fig:model} shows the overview of \\name. The targets where we want to position the class centers on the hypersphere are pre-computed prior to training and kept fixed thereafter. During training, the target positions are assigned to the classes online, and a targeted supervised contrastive loss is designed to encourage samples from each class to move to the assigned target position.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.46\\textwidth]{tcl_model}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-10pt}\n\\caption{\\small Illustration of \\name. It first computes the optimal targets for the class centers on the hypersphere. Then, during training, in each iteration, each target is assigned to the nearest class, and a targeted contrastive learning loss is designed to encourage the samples from each class to move to the assigned target position. }\n\\label{fig:model}\n\\vspace{-10pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Target Generation}\n\nWe first compute the optimal positions for the targets in the feature space. Since the test dataset is equally distributed among classes in long-tailed recognition, and the features in contrastive learning are positioned on a unit-hypersphere $\\mathcal{S}^{d-1} = \\{u \\in \\mathbb{R}^d: ||u|| = 1\\}$~\\cite{chen2020simple,he2020momentum}, \nthe ideal class targets should be uniformly distributed on this hypersphere. \nNote that computing these ideal target positions does not require access to the data, and only requires knowing the number of classes and the dimension of the feature space. \nThus, similar to the uniformity loss defined in \\cite{wang2020understanding}, we design the target positions of $C$ classes, $\\{t^*_i\\}_{i=1}^C$, as the minimizer of \n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{u}(\\{t_i\\}_{i=1}^C) = \\frac{1}{C}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^C \\log \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^C e^{t_i^T\\cdot t_j/\\tau}.\n\\end{equation}\n\nIntuitively, we want the target positions on the hypersphere to be as far away from each other as possible. The ideal locations would be perfectly uniformly distributed on the hypersphere, forming the vertices of a regular simplex (i.e. $\\exists \\delta \\in \\mathbb{R}, t_i^T\\cdot t_j = \\delta, \\forall i,j, i\\neq j$ and $\\sum\\limits_i t_i = 0$)\\cite{graf2021dissecting}. \nHowever, when the dimension of the hypersphere is not large enough (e.g., $d<(C-1)$), computing the minimum of the above equation analytically becomes very hard~\\cite{graf2021dissecting}.\\footnote{Even for the well-studied Thomson problem, which tries to determine the most uniform (minimum electrostatic potential energy) arrangement of $N$ electrons on a 3D sphere, the solutions are known only for $N = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,12\\}$.} Therefore, $\\{t^*_i\\}_{i=1}^C$ are calculated by gradient descent on $\\mathcal{L}_{u}$, where $t_i$ is restricted to be on the hypersphere. Note that the minimum of $\\mathcal{L}_{u}$ after gradient descent will be equal to its analytical minimum when $d\\geq(C-1)$.\n\n\\subsection{Matching-Training Scheme}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Class-Target Assignment.} Once we obtain a set of target positions, we need to assign a class label to each target. One way to do so is to randomly assign class labels to target positions. However, this will lead to a feature space with very poor semantics. This is because some target positions may be close to each other on the hypersphere and some are far away, especially when the number of classes is large (e.g., ImageNet and iNaturalist). Ideally, classes that are semantically close to each other should be assigned to target positions that are also close to each other.\n\nIt is hard however to accurately quantify semantic closeness between two classes. Even if we could quantify it, i.e., there is a well-defined ``semantic distance'' between two classes, it is computationally hard (i.e., no poly-time solution)\nto compute the optimal assignment that matches classes with target positions while keeping the semantic distance between classes consistent with the euclidean distance between their targets.\\footnote{This problem can be formulated as the matching problem between two adjacency matrices. The graph isomorphism problem \\cite{fortin1996graph}, which is not known to be solvable in polynomial time yet, can be reduced to this problem.} \n\nTo solve this problem, we design a heuristic algorithm that finds a good assignment, while preserving the semantic structure of the feature space. Instead of pre-computing the assignment, we do it adaptively during training. Specifically,  \nafter each iteration in the training process, we use the Hungarian Algorithm \\cite{kuhn1955hungarian} to find the assignment $\\{\\sigma^*_i\\}_{i=1}^C$  that minimizes the distance between the target positions and the normalized class centers assigned to them, i.e.:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{\\sigma^*_i\\}_i =  \\argmin\\limits_{\\{\\sigma_i\\}_i} \\frac{1}{C}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^C ||t_{\\sigma_i} - c_i||,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $c_i = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{v_j \\in F_i} v_j}{||\\sum\\limits_{v_j \\in F_i} v_j||_2}$ and $F_i$ is the set of features from class $i$. In practice, since a batch may contain only a subset of all classes, we keep track of the centers of each class using a weighted moving average. To be specific, in every iteration, we compute the new class centers $c_i'$ for each class in the batch, and update the recorded $c_i$ by $c_i \\gets 0.9\\cdot c_i + 0.1\\cdot c_i'$. As shown in Sec. \\ref{subsec:ablation}, this  assignment algorithm demonstrates good performance on preserving the semantic structure of the feature space.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Targeted Supervised Contrastive Loss.} To leverage the assigned targets, we design a targeted supervised contrastive loss $\\mathcal{L}_{TSC}$. Given a batch of data samples $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$, where $y_i \\in [C]$ is the class label of $x_i$. Define $v_i$ as the features of $x_i$ on the unit-hypersphere $\\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$, $\\Tilde{v_i}$ as the features generated by augmenting $x_i$, $V_i =  \\{v_n\\}_{n=1}^N \\backslash \\{v_i\\} $ as the current batch of features excluding $v_i$ and $V_{i, k}^+ \\subseteq V_i$ the positive set of $v_i$ containing $k$ features uniformly drawn from $\\{v_j \\in V_i: y_j = y_i\\}$. Let $\\Tilde{V_i} = \\{\\tilde{v_i}\\}\\cup V_i$ and $\\Tilde{V_{i, k}^+} = \\{\\Tilde{v_i}\\}\\cup V_{i, k}^+$. $\\mathcal{L}_{TSC}$ is then defined as:\n\n\\begin{gather}\n\\begin{aligned}\n     \\mathcal{L}_{TSC} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Big(&\\frac{1}{k+1}\\sum_{v_j^+ \\in \\Tilde{V^+_{i, k}}}  \\log \\frac{e^{v_i^T\\cdot v_j^+/\\tau}}{ \\sum\\limits_{v_j\\in \\Tilde{V_i} \\cup U} e^{v_i^T\\cdot v_j/\\tau}}\\\\\n    &+ \\lambda  \\log \\frac{e^{v_i^T\\cdot c^*_i/\\tau}}{ \\sum\\limits_{v_j\\in \\Tilde{V_i} \\cup U} e^{v_i^T\\cdot v_j/\\tau}}\\Big),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\label{eq:loss}\n\\raisetag{30pt}\n\\end{gather}\nwhere $U=\\{t^*_i\\}_{i=1}^C$ is the set of pre-compute targets, and $c^*_i = t^*_{\\sigma^*_{y_i}}$ is the assigned target of the corresponding class. Note that the loss is the sum of two components. The first is a standard contrastive loss as used by KCL~\\cite{kang2020exploring}, whereas the second is a contrastive loss between the target and the samples in the batch. This latter loss moves the samples closer to the target of their class and away from the targets of other classes.\n\n$\\mathcal{L}_{TSC}$ forces projections from each class to be aligned with its assigned target, while distributing the targets uniformly on the hypersphere, and thus is  beneficial for long-tailed recognition tasks. \n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:results}\n\nWe evaluate \\name~on multiple long-tailed benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performances.\n\n\\subsection{Experiment Setup}\n\\label{subsec:setup}\nWe perform extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, like CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR100-LT (The MIT License), and large-scale long-tailed datasets, such as ImageNet-LT (CC BY 2.0 license) \\cite{liu2019large} and iNaturalist (CC0, CC BY or CC BY-NC license) \\cite{van2018inaturalist}.  CIFAR10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT are sampled with an exponential decay across classes. The imbalance ratio $\\rho$ is defined as the number of samples in the most frequent class divided by that of the least frequent class. Similar to previous works, we evaluate \\name~on imbalance ratios of 10, 50 and 100 and a ResNet-32 backbone \\cite{yang2020rethinking}. For ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist, we evaluate \\name\\ on a ResNet-50 backbone \\cite{kang2020exploring,kang2019decoupling,wang2020long}.\n\nFollowing \\cite{kang2019decoupling, kang2020exploring}, we implement \\name~on long-tailed recognition datasets using a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we train the representation encoder with the \\name~loss. In the second stage, we train a linear classifier on top of the learned representation. For CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT, the linear classifier is trained with LDAM loss and class re-weighting. For ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist, the linear classifier is trained with CE loss and class-balanced sampling. We also empirically find that in the early training, it is better to first warm up the network by not assigning targets and training the network with just the KCL loss. Therefore, for ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist, we start the class target assignment after half of the total epochs. Following the KCL loss, we use $k=6$ for the TSC loss. We use the same data augmentations as previous works, including the non-contrastive learning baselines. We provide a detailed description of the implementation of our method in the appendix. All results are averaged over 3 trials with different random seeds.\n\nThere are mainly two types of works on long-tailed recognition: 1) single model training scheme design, such as new sampling strategies \\cite{kang2019decoupling} or new losses \\cite{cui2019class, cao2019learning, kang2020exploring}, and 2) ensembling over different data distributions, which re-organizes long-tailed data into groups, trains a model per group, and combines individual models in a multi-expert framework. Prior work~\\cite{wang2020long} shows that these two approaches are orthogonal and can be combined together to improve performance. Our work falls in the first type of works. Therefore, we first compare \\name~with  established state-of-the-art single model baselines, including \\cite{cao2019learning, kang2019decoupling, kang2020exploring, kim2020m2m}, and then show that the combination of \\name~and ensemble-based models can further improve its performance. Also, the literature compares different baselines for different datasets~\\cite{yang2020rethinking,kang2020exploring,wang2020long}. \\red{Thus, for each dataset, we compare with the typical and SOTA baselines for that dataset. }\n\n\\subsection{Results}\n\n\\textbf{CIFAR-10-LT \\& CIFAR-100-LT.} Table \\ref{tab:cifar} compares \\name~with state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT. It shows that, unlike other SOTA methods, \\name~demonstrates consistent improvements over all baselines on all imbalance ratios in both datasets. This demonstrates that \\name~can be generalized to different imbalance ratios and datasets easily as its design does not require prior knowledge of the imbalance ratio of the dataset.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\caption{\\small Top-1 accuracy (\\%) of ResNet-32 on long-tailed CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. \\name\\ consistently improves on past imbalanced learning techniques and achieves the best performance.

We also conduct thorough ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the \\name~pipeline. \n\n\\subsection{Understanding the Learned Representations}\n\\label{subsec:metrics}\nIn contrastive learning the features are regularized to fall on a hypershpere~\\cite{chen2020simple,he2020momentum}, and the loss directly optimizes the distance between instances in the feature space. Thus, we can use distance in the feature space to evaluate the quality of learned representations. We propose several metrics to evaluate representations learned from long-tailed dataset, and study why \\name~achieves better performance on long-tailed recognition than past work, e.g., KCL.\n\n\\textbf{Intra-Class Alignment.} One optimization goal of the contrastive loss is to minimize the distance between positive samples. Similar to \\cite{wang2020understanding}, we define alignment under the supervised contrastive learning setting as the average distances between samples from the same class, where $F_i$ is the set of features from class $i$:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\textbf{A}=\\frac{1}{C}\\sum_{i=1}^C \\frac{1}{|F_i|^2}\\sum_{v_j, v_k\\in F_i}||v_j-v_k||_2.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\textbf{Inter-Class Uniformity.} Another optimization goal of contrastive loss is to maximize the distance between negative samples. Hence, we define inter-class uniformity under the supervised contrastive learning setting as the average distances between different class centers:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\textbf{U}=\\frac{1}{C(C-1)}\\sum_{i=1}^C\\sum_{j=1, j\\neq i}^C||c_i-c_j||_2,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $c_i$ is the center of samples from class $i$ on the hypersphere: $c_i = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{v_j \\in F_i} v_j}{||\\sum\\limits_{v_j \\in F_i} v_j||_2}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{fig3.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-5pt}\n\\caption{\\small\nExample feature distributions of 3 classes with the same intra-class alignment and inter-class uniformity but different nearest neighborhood uniformity $U_1$. Because the nearest neighbor class is too close, the decision boundary between the green class and the orange class in (a) is not clean.}\n\\label{fig:balance}\n\\vspace{-10pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\textbf{Neighborhood Uniformity.} Though intra-class alignment and inter-class  uniformity are important metrics to measure the quality of learned representations, they cannot evaluate how close one class is to its neighbors. For example, as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:balance}, although both (a) and (b) achieve the same alignment and uniformity, (b) shows better neighborhood uniformity in the feature space and clearer decision boundaries between the green class and the orange class. \n\nSince what we really care about is only those classes that are too close to each other because the decision boundaries between them can be unclear, we define neighborhood uniformity as the distance to the top-$k$ closest class centers of each class:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\textbf{U}_k=\\frac{1}{Ck}\\sum_{i=1}^C\\min_{j_1,\\cdots, j_k}(\\sum_{l=1}^k||c_i-c_{j_l}||_2),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $j_1, \\cdots, j_k \\neq i$ are different classes.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{tcl_class}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-15pt}\n\\caption{Illustration of semantic distance between two classes.}\n\\label{fig:semantic}\n\\vspace{-5pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\textbf{Reasonability.} For better generalization, the learned feature space should also keep a reasonable semantic structure, i.e. ,classes that are semantically close to each other should also be close in feature space. Therefore, we define reasonability as the semantic distance between each class and its top-$k$ closest classes. The semantic distance of two classes is computed using WordNet hierarchy \\cite{miller1995wordnet}, which is a hierarchical structure that contains all ImageNet classes as leaf nodes. The semantic distance of two classes is then defined as the shortest distance between the two leaf nodes in WordNet hierarchy. For example, as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:semantic}, the semantic distance between Cougar and Ice bear is 6.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\caption{\\name~achieves better uniformity, neighborhood uniformity and reasonability than KCL on ImageNet-LT, while keeping almost the same alignment.

The results highlight several good properties of \\name~over KCL: 1.) \\name~achieves better uniformity, neighborhood uniformity, and reasonability than KCL on all class splits, while keeping almost the same alignment as KCL. 2.) Although \\name's uniformity is only 0.06 higher than that of KCL, its neighborhood uniformity (the average uniformity of the closest 10 classes) is 0.17 higher than that of KCL. Moreover, KCL's neighborhood uniformity is even worse on tail classes, while \\name~keeps consistent neighborhood uniformity over all classes. This demonstrates the effectiveness of \\name~on keeping all classes away from each other, and thus allowing clearer decision boundaries between classes. 3.) \\name~achieves better reasonability than KCL, especially on tail classes, showing that the learned feature space is not only uniform but also semantically reasonable.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.46\\textwidth]{fig5}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-7.5pt}\n\\caption{Feature distribution and accuracy of (a) KCL and (b) \\name~on CIFAR-10-LT with imbalance ratio 100.

This phenomenon is also shown in \\cite{kang2019decoupling}, where the author shows that instance-balanced sampling achieves the best results among different sampling strategies during representation learning. \\name\\ uses instance-balanced sampling, and achieves good uniformity using pre-computed targets.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\caption{Balanced positive sampling strategy improves less on TSC than on FCL on ImageNet-LT.}\n\\vspace{-5mm}\n\\label{tab:kclvsfcl}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{.43\\textwidth}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}\n\\toprule\nMethods  & Many & Medium & Few & All \\\\ \n\\midrule\nFCL \\cite{kang2020exploring} & 61.4 & 47.0 & 28.2 & 49.8 \\\\\nKCL \\cite{kang2020exploring} & 61.8 & 49.4 & 30.9 & 51.5 \\\\\n\\name~(FCL) & 62.7 & 49.2 & 30.1 & 51.8 \\\\\n\\name~(KCL) & 63.5 & 49.7 & 30.4 & 52.4 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-15pt}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\textbf{Benefits of Balanced Positive Samples.} \\cite{kang2020exploring} has shown that sampling positive pairs in a balanced way (as done in KCL) is better than taking all samples of the same class as positives (as done in FCL).

However, we also notice that this balanced positive sampling strategy brings much less improvement to \\name~than KCL. As shown in Table \\ref{tab:kclvsfcl}, the balanced positive sampling strategy in KCL improves 1.7\\% over FCL, while improves 0.7\\% over \\name~with FCL.

We empirically showed that, for unbalanced data, features learned by traditional supervised contrastive losses lead to reduced uniformity and unclear class boundaries, and hence poorer performance. By assigning uniformly distributed targets to each class during training, \\name~avoids this problem, leading to a more uniform and balanced feature space. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that \\name\\ achieves state-of-the-art single-model performance on all benchmark datasets for long-tailed recognition.\n\nNonetheless, \\name\\ has some limitations. First, the optimal targets of \\name\\ are computed using stochastic gradient descent. The analytical optimal solution of points on a hypersphere that minimize an energy potential remains an open problem (Thomson problem). Though \\name\\ uses an approximate solution, the empirical results show consistent and significant performance gain. Second, \\name~requires knowing the number of classes in advance to compute the targets; so, it is not applicable to problems where the number of classes is unknown. Despite these limitations, we believe that \\name~provides an important step forward for long-tailed recognition, and delivers new insights on how data distribution affects key properties of contrastive learning. \n\n {\\small\n   }\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 2>\n\n<paper 3>\n\\title{Long-Tail Learning with Rebalanced Contrastive Loss}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{frontmatter}\n\n\\setcounter{page}{1}\n\n\\title{Long-Tail Learning with Rebalanced Contrastive Loss}\n\n\\author[1]{Charika \\surname{De Alvis}\\corref{cor1}} \n\\cortext[cor1]{Corresponding author: \n }\n\\ead{charika.weerasiriwardhane@sydney.edu.au}\n\\author[1]{Dishanika \\surname{Denipitiyage}}\n\\ead{Dishanika.Denipitiyage@sydney.edu.au}\n\\author[1]{Suranga \\surname{Seneviratne}}\n\\ead{Suranga.Seeviratne@sydney.edu.au}\n\n\\affiliation[1]{organization={The University of Sydney},\n                addressline={Camperdown NSW }, \n                city={Sydney}, \n                postcode={2050}, \n                state={NSW},\n                country={Australia}}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nIntegrating supervised contrastive loss to cross entropy-based classification has recently been proposed as a solution to address the long-tail learning problem. However, when the class imbalance ratio\n is high, it requires adjusting the supervised contrastive loss to support the tail classes, as the conventional contrastive learning is biased towards head classes by default. To this end, we present Rebalanced Contrastive Learning (RCL), an efficient means to increase the long-tail classification accuracy by addressing three main aspects: 1. Feature space balancedness -- Equal division of the feature space among all the classes 2. Intra-Class compactness -- Reducing the distance between same-class embeddings 3. Regularization -- Enforcing larger margins for tail classes to reduce overfitting. RCL adopts class frequency-based SoftMax loss balancing to supervised contrastive learning loss and exploits scalar multiplied features fed to the contrastive learning loss to enforce compactness. We implement RCL on the Balanced Contrastive Learning (BCL) Framework, which has the SOTA performance. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the richness of the learnt embeddings and increased top-1 balanced accuracy RCL provides to the BCL framework. We further demonstrate that the performance of RCL as a standalone loss also achieves state-of-the-art level accuracy. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\end{frontmatter}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec1}\nThe data imbalance between different classes usually hinders training an unbiased classifier. This is a significant problem, especially when the tail class is of great importance for applications such as pedestrian classification, fraud detection, and spam filtering. While approaches such as data resampling and loss reweighting are used to alleviate class imbalance, these approaches increase the tail classes' accuracy by sacrificing the head class accuracy.\nAn important aspect of a robust model is the capability to address the distribution shift from training (long-tail) to unknown test (uniform or inversely long-tailed) distributions. Later in some frameworks, cross-entropy loss for long-tail learning is combined with metric learning or contrastive learning. According to \\cite{elm} \nstrong performance improvement occurs when the cross-entropy loss is combined with Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL). This work demonstrates that learning better embeddings can assist in resolving most of the long-tail classification challenges, as better embeddings can contribute to more generalized classifiers. Along this line, one approach is decoupling representation and classifier learning (\\cite{kang2019decoupling}). However, the representations learned through SCL (\\cite{scl}) cannot fully eliminate the dominance of the most frequent classes or maintain the linear separability of embeddings from head-to-tail classes without necessary adjustments for long-tail distributions. Therefore, improving SCL to handle long-tail data distributions more robustly is important.\n\n\\cite{bcl} propose balanced contrastive loss BCL, an improved SCL loss for the context of long-tail learning where the main intuition is to average the attraction and repulsion terms based on the mini-batch class frequency so that each class equally contributes to the optimization process. We propose a means to further enhance the quality of the learnt embedding of BCL from the perspectives of balancedness, intra-class compactness, and regularization using Rebalanced Contrastive Learning (RCL). We emphasize that the RCL is not limited to working with BCL only. Given its simplicity of implementation, it can be incorporated into any SCL method. More specifically, we make the following contributions.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item We propose  RCL  to optimize the learnt representation of  SCL/BCL through i) \n establishing the robustness for distribution shift from train (long-tail) to test (uniform) using the adopted class frequency-based SoftMax balancing, ii) enforcing intra-class compactness for tail classes through scalar multiplied features fed to the contrastive loss, and iii) enforcing better class separation through enforced class frequency based embedding margins.\n\\item By conducting experiments on the long-tail versions of the three benchmark datasets: CIFAR10\\_Lt, CIFAR100\\_Lt, and ImageNet\\_Lt, we show that the addition of RCL over SCL/BCL improves the top-1 balanced accuracy. Our ablation study further shows that RCL as a standalone metric also increases the top-1 harmonic mean accuracy, indicating improvements in the least-performing classes.\n   \n \\item We conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the learnt embeddings and show that adding RCL to BCL enhances class separability with larger margins through balancedness, intra-class compactness, and regularization.\n \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Related Works}\n We explain related work in long-tail classification methods under three topics: i) Data-level solutions, ii) Algorithmic-level solutions, and iii) SCL-based approaches.  \n \n\\subsection{ Data-Level Solutions}Early works in long-tail learning include data-level solutions such as random oversampling, random undersampling (\\cite{126}), %\\cite{127}%\\cite{128}\\cite{129} \nsquare root sampling (\\cite{root}) and progressively balanced sampling (\\cite{kang2019decoupling}) that suffer from over-fitting or under-fitting to data. Re-weighting methods (\\cite{cb,shu2019meta}) assign weights on different training samples based on the label or instance (hard or easy samples) and have shown significant accuracy increments over few-shot classes. However, re-weighting methods tend to sacrifice the many-shot accuracy. Classifier balancing techniques such as fine-tuning the learnt classifier (\\cite{guerriero2018deepncm}), post-hoc calibrations (\\cite{menon2020long,kang2019decoupling}), domainshift calibrations (\\cite{peng2022optimal}) alleviate the imbalances of the data. However, these methods may not be sufficient under extreme class imbalance factor and when the number of classes is very high. Data augmentation is also used to improve accuracy for classes suffering from absolute rarity (\\cite{150}). \\cite{102} use generative models to generate new samples for tail classes as a convex combination of existing samples. Transferring the information from head classes to tail classes also provides promising results (\\cite{100}). Yet, these methods can not completely eliminate the tail class over-fitting and the dominance of head classes. \n\n\\subsection{Algorithmic-Level Solutions}\nUnder algorithmic level solutions integrating a per-class margin (\\cite{menon2020long,metasoftmax}) into the cross-entropy loss is a popular work direction. In most cases, the logit margin is set as inversely proportional to the class frequency to enforce a larger margin for tail classes to enhance generalization. However, these methods do not control the learned feature distributions explicitly. Therefore, it is important to use techniques to optimize the learned feature distribution to avoid the diffusion of the rare classes. \n\n\\subsection{Representation Optimization With SCL }The contrastive learning-based methods have been used recently in the context of long-tail learning as they contribute to better feature representation by aligning the same class pairs together and repulsing the different class pairs. \\cite{target} propose a novel technique to improve SCL to compute optimal class centres and evenly balance the features space. Then, they associate the generated class centres with actual class IDs, considering mutual closeness. However, the results here could be suboptimal since there is no deterministic strategy to associate the class centres with the true classes. \\cite{prototype} introduce an improved SCL framework denoted as prototypical supervised contrastive (PSC) learning where it learns prototypes for each class; subsequently, each instance is to be pushed towards the prototypes of its corresponding class and pulled away from the other class prototypes. In this approach, tail class instances may have a larger effect on the model optimization than head class instances, sacrificing the head class accuracy. To address this issue, \\cite{sub} showcase subclass-balancing contrastive learning where the loss is defined on subclasses equal to the tail class size inside the head classes through clustering. Here, the authors balance the  SCL loss accordingly to support long-tail classification scenarios with higher class imbalance and subsequently balanced SCL loss is jointly minimized with CE loss. Our work focus on a novel yet simpler approach based on BalanceSoftmax concept to efficiently balance the SCL component so that it can significantly enhance the balancedness, intra-class compactness, and tail-class margins through rebalancing the BCL loss. \n\\section{Methodology}\n\\label{sec:formatting}\n\\subsection{Notations}\n   Multiclass classification problem can be defined by input instance domain $\\mathcal{X}$, class label domain is given by $ Y=[L]=\\{1,â€¦â€¦,L\\}$. For a set of training samples $ S = {(x_i,y_i)}_{i=1}^N \\sim^{i.i.d} P^N  $ where joint distribution P characterized on $\\mathcal{X} \\times Y$. All the weights corresponding to the model are denoted by $W$. The multi-class learning task is to learn a scorer $f : \\mathcal{X} \\to R^L$ so that it minimizes the expected loss $l:Y \\times R^L \\to R_+$.\nThe scorer corresponding to class y is $f_y(x_i) = w_y^T z_i +b_y$, where $ w_y \\in R^K$ are the weights of the last fully connected classification layer corresponding to class y. And $b_y \\in R $ is the bias. Learned embedding corresponding to the input $x_i$ is $z_i \\in R^K$. Further, we denote the batch frequency of class y by $|By|$ and the learnt class prototype by $c_y$ as defined in the work of \\cite{bcl}. \n\n\\subsection{Preliminaries}\n\\label{l1}\n\\subsubsection{ CE Based Classification:} Our work makes use of fundamental Cross Entropy (CE) modification methods for long-tail learning. Firstly, as the SoftMax function is inherently biased under long-tail learning, a Balanced SoftMax function (\\cite{metasoftmax}) is proposed to address the train-to-test distribution shift from a probabilistic perspective. The modified loss is denoted in Equation~\\ref{2}. The authors provided an analytical derivation that optimizing for the Balanced SoftMax cross-entropy loss is essentially equivalent to minimizing the bound on generalization error. The second interesting approach is logit adjustment (LA) proposed by \\cite{menon2020long} that allows larger margins for tail classes, which can be denoted with Equation~\\ref{4}. Here $\\pi_y$ denotes the probability of class y. This model is more favourable as $\\tau$ provides the degree of freedom to adjust for different datasets and class imbalance levels.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{Balanced\\_SoftMax\\_Function} = - \\log \\frac{n_y e^{f_y(x)}}{\\sum_{i \\in L} n_i e^{f_i(x)}}\n\\label{2}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{Logit\\_Adjusted\\_Loss}= - \\log \\frac{ e^{f_y(x)+\\tau\\log{\\pi_y}}}{\\sum_{i \\in L}  e^{f_i(x)+\\tau\\log{\\pi_i}}}\n\\label{4}\n\\end{equation}\n\n \\subsubsection{ SCL Integration:} Above LA cross entropy classification module combined with a supervised contrastive learning module to enhance the long-tail classification accuracy. The supervised contrastive learning component is balanced through class averaging and class complements (\\cite{bcl}). The new loss is denoted as balanced contrastive loss BCL. This loss avoids the bias occurred towards the head classes. Class complements is an effort to have all classes to be present in every mini batch through the use of class centre prototypes. When the rare class instances are missing from a batch the centre embedding would act as an actual training instance. Refer to the BCL loss component given in Equation~\\ref{bcl} for the use \nof class averaging and class complements.\n\\begin{equation}\nL_{\\text{BCL}}=-\\frac{1}{|B_y|} \\cdot \\\\ \\sum\\limits_{p\\in {B_y \\{i\\}} \\cup \\{c_y\\}}\\log \\frac{e^{z_i.z_p}}{\\sum\\limits_{j\\in Y}\\frac{1}{|B_j|+1}\\sum\\limits_{k \\in B_j \\cup \\{c_j\\}} e^{z_i.z_k}}\n\\label{bcl}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Our proposed approach RCL is implemented on  BCL to incorporate more balancedness through the adopted balanced SoftMax concept and enforce larger margins for tail classes. The BCL + RCL  is integrated with the logit-adjusted CE loss to conduct the classification. Furthermore, RCL loss can be implemented on different supervised contrastive losses along with any combination of cross-entropy loss with class imbalance adjustment. \n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\hspace{-10mm}\n\\begin{subfigure}[]{0.45\\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{t1.png}\n\\caption{ Learnt Feature Distribution }\n \\label{cc1}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\begin{subfigure}[]{0.45\\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=1.15\\linewidth]{t2.png}\n\\caption{Ideal Feature Distribution }\n\\label{cc3}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\n\\caption{ (a) This figure denotes the distribution of the penultimate layer embeddings in a 2D space in the class imbalanced \ncase.

We adopt the same augmentation methods in BCL framework. A common backbone is used for both branches. Total loss is minimized during the training process.}\n   \\label{pipe}\n   \\vspace{-5mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Feature Representation Optimization With RCL}\nOur RCL-based approach addresses three key aspects in the embedding space that can directly contribute to increasing accuracy: 1) Balanced feature space, 2) Intra-class compactness, and 3) Assigning larger margins to ambiguous classes. These key aspects are expected to provide more support for tail class classification. Figure~\\ref{cc1} denotes the distribution of the learned embedding under the class imbalance for a simple separable 2D problem. The majority class tend to occupy the larger area of the feature space with larger margins, thus allowing larger generalisation on the head classes and over-fitting to minority classes. In Figure~\\ref{pipe}, we illustrate the pipeline for the RCL-based learning. In this work, we analyse the RCL directly applied to the SCL loss, and secondly, RCL is applied to the BCL loss. \n\\subsubsection{Balancing Feature Space}\nIt was noted that unsupervised contrastive learning methods are more robust to highly imbalanced class distributions compared to supervised contrastive learning (\\cite{self}). The reason for this phenomenon is that the unsupervised CL methods generate a balanced feature space for all the classes compared to SCL. To this end, some research focuses on pushing the learnt embeddings into pre-defined class centres to obtain the balance (\\cite{target}). In this work, we try to obtain balancedness by balancing the  SCL loss sufficiently. The modified SCL loss is defined as Rebalanced Contrastive Loss (RCL). We adopt the Balanced SoftMax concept described in Section~\\ref{l1} to modify the SCL loss as indicated in Equation~\\ref{rcl1}. Where $n_y$ is the frequency of the class y in the complete training set. \n\\begin{equation}\nL_{\\text{RCL}}=-\\frac{1}{|B_y|} \\cdot \\\\ \\sum\\limits_{p\\in {B_y \\{i\\}} }\\log \\frac{\\mathcolor{blue}{n_y}e^{z_i.z_p}}{\\sum\\limits_{j\\in Y} \\mathcolor{blue}{n_j}\\sum\\limits_{k \\in B_j } e^{z_i.z_k}}\n\\label{rcl1}\n\\end{equation}\n\\subsubsection{Enforcing Feature Compactness}\nMinimizing the intra-class distance among the same class embeddings is a main aspect of interest as it reduces the deviation of the features across the decision boundary and enhances class discriminativeness. Feature Clusters Compression (FCC) (\\cite{fcc}) is applied previously to decrease the diffusion of backbone features by compressing learnt embeddings. This is achieved by multiplying original learnt features by a selected scaling factor and using the multiplied\nfeatures in computing the cross entropy loss for classifier learning. In this work, we modify this approach and integrate the feature compression component directly into the RCL instead of sending it through the classifier as in CE minimization, i.e., $\\tilde{z_i}=z_i * \\tau_i$. The features are scalar multiplied before feeding to the SCL loss. The intuition is to provide a higher degree of freedom to reshape features based on feature compression. The scaling factor $\\tau>0$ and value is selected based on the class id. At the $ epoch= \\frac{total\\_epochs}{2}$, the validation accuracy is obtained, and if the validation per class accuracy is lower than $(20\\%)$, a novel scaling factor is applied for the corresponding classes and for the rest of the classes, the factor is set to 1 (only two $\\tau$ values are used for the entire dataset). The scaling factor used on the underperforming classes is selected based on a grid search. The RCL modification with feature compression can be implemented on BCL to enhance the balancedness as in Equation \\ref{bcl1}. The fraction in red is the class averaged similarity scores. \n\\begin{equation}\nL_{\\text{BCL+RCL}}=-\\frac{1}{|B_y|} \\cdot \\\\ \\sum\\limits_{p\\in {B_y \\{i\\}} \\cup \\{c_y\\}}\\log \\frac{\\mathcolor{blue}{n_y}e^{\\tilde{z}_i.\\tilde{z}_p}}{\\sum\\limits_{j\\in Y} \\mathcolor{blue}{n_j}\\mathcolor{red}{\\frac{1}{|B_j|+1}\\sum\\limits_{k \\in B_j \\cup \\{c_j\\}} e^{\\tilde{z}_i.\\tilde{z}_k}}}\n\\label{bcl1}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsubsection{Regularization}\nThe rare classes must be more strongly regularized compared to frequent classes to reduce the generalization error of the rare classes without sacrificing the accuracy of majority classes. To achieve this it requires a data-dependant or label-dependent regularizer rather than the standard L2 regularize, which only depends on the model weights. Therefore, the data-dependent properties like class margins can be useful.  Enforcing a larger margin for a class can be interpreted as regularization (\\cite{cao2019learning}) because the inverse of the minimum margin among all the examples is linked with the standard generalization error bounds. \\cite{elm} demonstrate that enforcing logit margins is insufficient under extreme imbalance scenarios, and therefore, embedding margins are required to enhance the regularization of the minority classes. We demonstrate the RCL's importance in enforced embedding margins by reformulating it as in Equation~\\ref{eq3} followed by Equation~\\ref{eq4}. According to this format, it is evident that margin is implicitly enforced for the similarity score between the same class and dissimilar class embeddings based on the class frequency. We can further analyse the loss to get a comprehensive insight considering the pairwise margin loss.\n\\begin{equation}\nL_{\\text{RCL}}=-\\frac{1}{|B_y|} \\cdot \\\\ \\sum\\limits_{p\\in {B_y \\text{\\textbackslash} \\{i\\}} }\\log \\frac{e^{log(n_y)}e^{\\Tilde{z_i}.\\Tilde{z_p}}}{\\sum\\limits_{j\\in Y} \\sum\\limits_{k \\in B_j } e^{log(n_j)}e^{\\Tilde{z_i}.\\Tilde{z_k}}}\n\\label{eq3}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nL_{\\text{RCL}}=\\frac{1}{|B_y|} \\cdot  \\sum\\limits_{p\\in {B_y \\text{\\textbackslash}\\{i\\}} }\\log[1+ \\sum\\limits_{j\\in Y} \\sum\\limits_{k \\in B_j \\text{\\textbackslash} \\{p\\}}e^{\\log (\\frac{n_j}{n_y})}e^{\\Tilde{z_i}.\\Tilde{z_k} -\\Tilde{z_i}.\\Tilde{z_p}}]\n\\label{eq4}\n\\end{equation}\n\nPairwise margins $\\log(\\frac{n_j}{n_y})$ denoted in Equation \\ref{eq4} enforces the desired gap between the similarity scores $\\Tilde{z_i}.\\Tilde{z_p}$ and $\\Tilde{z_i}.\\Tilde{z_k}$ depending on the belonginess to same or different classes. This imposes a larger margin between the tail intra-class similarity score and tail and head inter-class similarity score $(n_y<<n_j)$  so that it enhances the feature compactness within the tail class and increases the distance between head and tail feature clusters.  \nFigure~\\ref{cc3} denotes a 2D classification problem which portrays the ideally expected distribution of the learnt features under an imbalanced data distribution. All the classes occupy a similar area in the feature space, and the features are well compressed towards the class centre with larger margins for the rare classes.\n\\section{Experimental Setup and Results}\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation study for CIFAR100\\_Lt with IF-100  to test the additive effects of representation learning with SCL, BCL, and RCL.

Next, we describe the datasets, experiment design followed by comparisons of the results with the SOTA and ablation study. \n\n\\subsection{Datasets}\nWe use the long-tail versions of the benchmark datasets: CIFAR10\\_Lt, CIFAR100\\_Lt, \nand ImageNet\\_Lt. The level of class imbalance is measured by the Class Imbalance Factor (IF), which is the ratio between the most frequent class frequency and the least frequent class frequency. We set the maximum possible imbalance factors for the datasets, leaving at least 5-6 instances per tail class. Doing so, we obtain the following experiment settings; {\\bf i) CIFAR10\\_Lt:} No. of classes 10, IF - 100, majority class frequency - 5,000, {\\bf ii) CIFAR100\\_Lt:} No. of classes 100, IF - 100, majority class frequency - 500, {\\bf iii) ImageNet\\_Lt:} No. of classes 1,000, IF - 256, majority class frequency - 1,280.\n\n\\subsection{Implementation}\nReferring to the previous implementation, we use ResNet32 \n backbone for the CIFAR datasets and ResNext-50 \nand ResNet50 \nfor the ImageNet\\_Lt.\nModels are trained with a batch size of 256. Learning rate for CIFAR10\\_Lt and CIFAR100\\_Lt are set to 0.2  and for ImageNet\\_Lt 0.1. Similar to work of \\cite{paco} and \\cite{bcl}, we use Autoaugment (\\cite{autoaug}) and Cutout (\\cite{cutout}) for augmenting the features fed to the classifier. SimAugment (\\cite{simaugment}) is used for the features fed to the contrastive loss. The model was trained on a Amazon Cloud VM with 8xV100 GPUs.\n\n\\subsection{Ablation Study}\n\nWe conducted an ablation study on CIFAR100\\_Lt and CIFAR10\\_Lt with IF set to 100 to analyse the performance benefits of RCL. The overall balanced accuracy (averaged per class) is reported in Table~\\ref{t1} and Table~\\ref{t2}, respectively. As large values heavily influence arithmetic means in obtaining the overall class accuracy, we also report the harmonic mean to reflect the performance \nof the worst-performing classes. Initially, the dataset is tested for cross-entropy loss with LA (\\cite{menon2020long}). Where the logit adjustment parameter $\\tau$ is set to 1.3 for RCL through grid search. Then, the accuracy is evaluated by combining standard supervised contrastive loss with setting  $\\alpha$ to 2 and $\\beta$ to 1 and using SimAugment for augmentation. The compression factor is set to 1 for the classes with validation accuracy less than $20\\% $; for the other classes, the factor is set to 0.005. Compression is applied from the $100^{th}$ epoch.\n\nCIFAR100\\_Lt results in Table~\\ref{t1} show adding RCL to standard SCL would increase top-1 accuracy by $1.1\\%$ and harmonic mean accuracy by $3.2\\%$ (rows 2 and 4). When RCL is added to BCL, the top-1 accuracy increases by $0.2\\%$ and harmonic mean accuracy by $0.9\\%$ (rows 3 and 5). SCL+RCL demonstrates the highest harmonic mean accuracy of all the combinations.\n\nSimilarly, Table~\\ref{t2} shows the results for CIFAR10\\_Lt where adding RCL to SCL  increases top-1 accuracy by $2.5\\%$ and harmonic mean accuracy by $2.2\\%$ (rows 2 and 4). When RCL is added to BCL, the top-1 accuracy increases by $1.9\\%$ and harmonic mean accuracy by $2\\%$ (rows 3 and 5). SCL+BCL+RCL demonstrates the highest harmonic mean accuracy of all.\n\n\\begin{figure}[bt]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{Picture_1.pdf}\n    \\caption{Learnt embedding distribution for CIFAR10\\_Lt and CIFAR100\\_Lt (IF=100:1) in TSNE format.

Balanced overall test accuracy (arithmetic mean over per-class accuracy)\nis used for comparison. The selected categories of algorithmic level solutions  are 1) Standard and modified (logit adjusted) CE minimization, 2) Two-stage learning methods where representation learning and classifier fine-tuning are handled in different stages; 3) Ensemble methods where multiple experts combined to enhance the head and tail class accuracy simultaneously, 4) CE loss combined with an additional loss to handle representation learning explicitly, 5) CE loss combined with SCL loss to enhance representation learning.\n\n\\subsubsection{Results}\n\nWe show the results in Table 4. As can be seen, standalone RCL demonstrates satisfactory performance compared to the SOTA methods. The improvement over BCL is 1.7\\%,1.3\\% and 0.6\\% for CIFAR10\\_Lt for IF = 100, 50 and 10, respectively. Similar to CIFAR100\\_Lt, the values are 0.3\\%,0.2\\% and 0.7\\%. Even though the CIFAR100\\_Lt improvement over BCL is small compared to the other popular  SCL methods, RCL has a competitive performance.  Furthermore, BCL+RCL has consistent improvements 1.9\\%, 1.2\\%, and 0.9\\%  for CIFAR10\\_Lt. And for CIFAR100\\_Lt, the corresponding improvements are  0.2\\% for IF100 and 0.5 \\% IF=10. In summary,  BCL performs better for CIFAR100\\_Lt IF=50. For Imagenet\\_Lt, BCL+RCL outperforms BCL by 0.1\\% in both backbones according to Table~\\ref{imagenet}.\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{ Feature distribution evaluation based on class density and class separation using Calinski-Harabasz index (CHI) and Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI).  }\n\\begin{tabular}{ ccccc }\n\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Dataset (IF=100)}&\\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{BCL}}&\\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{BCL+RCL}}\\\\\n\\hline\n&CHI &DBI & CHI&DBI \\\\\nCIFAR100\\_Lt &3,962.9&0.97&4,091.8 &0.94\\\\\nCIFAR10\\_Lt &84.1&4.1&105.8&4.0\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{vmes}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsubsection{Embedding Space Analysis}\n\nAccording to the quantitative analysis of the RCL method performance, it is evident that standalone RCL applied to the standard SCL demonstrates SOTA competitive accuracy levels. Apart from this, RCL demonstrates an interesting aspect when applied to the BCL. Even though the accuracy improvement over BCL is relatively small, adding the RCL to the BCL enhances the learnt feature distribution. In Figure~\\ref{three}, we show the TSNE plots of the learnt representation of the model for CIFAR10\\_Lt and CIFAR100\\_Lt. BCL+RCL demonstrates a better class separation and balanced feature space division than BCL. As seen from Figure~\\ref{three}(a), in BCL, tail class embeddings are grouped into sub-clusters and are far apart. Once the features compression is added, all embeddings corresponding to the same tail class are grouped together, providing better intra-class compactness and balancedness in the space.  Figure~\\ref{three}(b) visually showcase the better class separation and balanced space distribution for all classes except for 1 and 9 compared to Figure~\\ref{three}(a); furthermore, when Figures~\\ref{three}(c) and (d) are compared, cluster balancedness has increased as a whole, as all classes occupy the feature space more equally compared to BCL when RCL is applied. In addition, compactness for classes 40 and 90 appears to increase significantly. To further validate this phenomenon, we compute the   Calinskiâ€“Harabasz index (\\cite{calin}) for the learnt features of the validation set.  A higher index value indicates better cluster cohesion and cluster separation.  Table~\\ref{vmes} indicates the index values for CIFAR10\\_Lt and CIFAR100\\_Lt.  Where we can see a consistent increment in the Calinskiâ€“Harabasz index for both datasets for BCL+RCL over BCL. Davies-Bouldin Index assesses the clustering quality where a lower value indicates more compact and well-separated clusters. According to the table, we can see that both datasets have a consistently lower value for BCL+RCL over BCL, which implies better cluster quality. The index is relatively insensitive to the choice of distance metric. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that RCL has the capability to optimize the distribution of the learnt feature simultaneously with the classification accuracy. The feature distribution is improved in balancedness, class compactness (cohesion) and regularization (larger margins, better class separation).\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThe paper proposed RCL for long-tail classification tasks. RCL addresses the balancedness of the learnt feature space,\nenforces feature compactness and increases the margin width for tail classes. RCL shows a competitive level of accuracy \nover SOTA methods over three benchmark datasets with imbalance factors up to 256. RCL was also validated to perform well as a standalone and integrated loss on BCL, an existing supervised contrastive learning loss specifically designed for long-tail classification. It would be an important future work to investigate how much RCL can contribute to optimizing the learnt feature distribution with self-supervised contrastive learning under extreme class imbalance (i.e., IF $>$ than 256). \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nThis research was conducted by the University of Sydney for National Intelligence Postdoctoral Grant (project number NIPG-2022-006) and funded by the Australian Government.\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 3>\n\nYour summary should follow these steps:\n- Title: Clearly state the main subject or topic of the summary.\n- Introduction: Describe the field and briefly introduce its history.

This issue arises due to the natural skewness in real-world data, where certain classes (the \"head\" classes) are overrepresented while others (the \"tail\" classes) are underrepresented. The problem is exacerbated in practical applications such as biological species identification, disease classification, and web spam detection, where tail classes often represent rare or critical entities that are essential for accurate classification. Over the years, various methods have been developed to tackle this challenge, including data re-balancing, two-stage training, and multi-expert frameworks. However, these methods often face a trade-off between improving the performance of head classes and tail classes, leading to a seesaw phenomenon where enhancing one group's accuracy comes at the expense of the other's.\n\nRecent advancements have introduced novel approaches to address this imbalance, leveraging contrastive learning and multi-expert architectures. These methods aim to improve the uniformity and separability of features in the embedding space, ensuring that both head and tail classes are well-represented and classified accurately. The field has seen significant progress, but the challenge remains to develop a single-stage method that can simultaneously enhance the accuracy of both head and tail classes without sacrificing the overall performance.\n\nThis summary focuses on three recent research papers that propose innovative solutions to long-tailed recognition. The first paper introduces Ally Complementary Experts (ACE), a one-stage multi-expert framework that improves the accuracy of both head and tail classes by adjusting the learning pace of each expert. The second paper presents Targeted Supervised Contrastive Learning (TSC), a method that generates uniformly distributed targets for class centers to maintain a balanced feature space. The third paper introduces Rebalanced Contrastive Loss (RCL), which modifies the supervised contrastive loss to enforce balanced feature space, intra-class compactness, and larger margins for tail classes. Each paper contributes to the field by addressing specific challenges and proposing novel techniques that enhance the performance of long-tailed recognition tasks.\n\n### Main Content of Each Paper\n\n#### Paper 1: Ally Complementary Experts (ACE)\nThe paper by Jiarui Cai et al. introduces ACE, a one-stage multi-expert framework designed to solve long-tailed recognition without the need for pre-training or multi-stage training. ACE is structured around a shared backbone and multiple experts, each trained on a subset of the data that is imbalanced but dominated by different splits. The authors propose a distribution-aware optimizer to adjust the learning pace of each expert, ensuring that they do not overfit to their respective subsets. Additionally, a complementary loss is introduced to suppress the output of interfering categories, allowing the experts to focus on their assigned categories without being disturbed by what they have never seen. The method is evaluated on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy across all categories, especially in medium and few-shot classes.\n\n**Innovations:**\n- **Multi-expert Framework:** ACE employs a multi-expert architecture where each expert is trained on a different subset of the data, ensuring specialization in their respective categories.\n- **Distribution-aware Optimizer:** This optimizer adjusts the learning rate of each expert based on the volume of its training set, preventing overfitting.\n- **Complementary Loss:** A soft regularization term is introduced to minimize the logits of non-target categories, promoting complementary rather than competitive learning among experts.\n\n#### Paper 2: Targeted Supervised Contrastive Learning (TSC)\nThe paper by Tianhong Li et al. proposes TSC, a method that addresses the poor uniformity of feature distributions in long-tailed datasets by assigning uniformly distributed targets to each class during training. These targets are pre-computed and kept fixed, ensuring that all classes are evenly distributed on a hypersphere. The TSC framework includes a matching-training scheme that adaptively matches samples from each class to one of the targets, preserving semantic structure and improving class separability. The method is evaluated on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist datasets, showing state-of-the-art performance on all benchmark datasets.\n\n**Innovations:**\n- **Target Generation:** TSC generates uniformly distributed targets for class centers in advance, ensuring a balanced feature space.\n- **Matching-training Scheme:** This scheme adaptively matches samples to targets, preserving semantic structure and improving class separability.\n- **Supervised Contrastive Loss:** The method uses a modified supervised contrastive loss to encourage samples from each class to move towards their assigned targets, enhancing feature uniformity.\n\n#### Paper 3: Rebalanced Contrastive Loss (RCL)\nThe paper by Charika De Alvis et al. presents RCL, a method that integrates class frequency-based balancing into supervised contrastive learning to address long-tailed recognition. RCL modifies the supervised contrastive loss to enforce balanced feature space, intra-class compactness, and larger margins for tail classes. The method is evaluated on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in accuracy and feature distribution quality.\n\n**Innovations:**\n- **Class Frequency-based Balancing:** RCL adopts the Balanced SoftMax concept to modify the supervised contrastive loss, ensuring that each class contributes equally to the optimization process.\n- **Feature Compression:** The method integrates feature compression directly into the contrastive loss, providing a higher degree of freedom to reshape features based on class frequency.\n- **Embedding Margins:** RCL enforces larger margins for tail classes, reducing generalization error and enhancing feature separability.\n\n### Commonalities and Innovations\nAll three papers aim to improve the accuracy of long-tailed recognition tasks by addressing the inherent imbalance in the data distribution. They share a common goal of achieving better feature representation and classification performance across all categories, especially the tail classes. However, each paper introduces unique techniques to tackle this challenge:\n\n- **ACE** leverages a multi-expert architecture with a distribution-aware optimizer and complementary loss to ensure that each expert specializes in a subset of the data without overfitting.\n- **TSC** generates uniformly distributed targets for class centers and uses a matching-training scheme to adaptively match samples to these targets, preserving semantic structure and improving class separability.\n- **RCL** integrates class frequency-based balancing and feature compression into supervised contrastive learning, enforcing larger margins for tail classes to reduce generalization error and enhance feature separability.\n\n### Comparison of Results\nThe performance of each method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist.

Future research could explore the integration of these methods into more complex tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation, as well as the application of RCL in self-supervised contrastive learning under extreme class imbalance. Additionally, further investigation into the stability and robustness of target generation in TSC and the effectiveness of different scaling factors in RCL could provide deeper insights into optimizing feature representations for long-tailed datasets."
