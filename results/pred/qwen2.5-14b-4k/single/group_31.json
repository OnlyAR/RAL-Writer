Shopkeepers calculate change, tax, and sale prices; agriculturists calculate the proper amounts of fertilizers, pesticides, and water for their crops; and managers analyze productivity. Even determining whether you have enough money to pay for a list of items requires applying addition, multiplication, and comparison. Solving these tasks is challenging as it involves recognizing how goals, entities, and quantities in the real-world map onto a mathematical formalization, computing the solution, and mapping the solution back onto the world. As a proxy for the richness of the real world, a series of papers have used natural language specifications of algebraic word problems, and solved these by either learning to fill in templates that can be solved with equation solvers~\\cite{DBLP:conf/emnlp/HosseiniHEK14,kushman-EtAl:2014:P14-1} or inferring and modeling operation sequences (programs) that lead to the final answer~\\cite{Roy2015SolvingGA}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n        {\\fontsize{8.5}{9}\\selectfont\n        \\hspace{-2mm}\n        \\begin{tabular}{|p{75mm}|}\n        \\hline\n        \\underline{\\textbf{Problem 1}}:\\\\\n        \\textbf{Question}: Two trains running in opposite directions cross a man standing on the platform in 27 seconds and 17 seconds respectively and they cross each other in 23 seconds.

Such rationales are what examiners require from students in order to demonstrate understanding of the problem solution; they play the very same role in our task. Not only do natural language rationales enhance model interpretability, but they provide a coarse guide to the structure of the arithmetic programs that must be executed. In fact the learner we propose (which relies on a heuristic search; \\S\\ref{sec:program_induction})\nfails to solve this task without modeling the rationales---the search space is too unconstrained.\n\nThis work is thus related to models that can explain or rationalize their decisions~\\citep{hendricks:2016,DBLP:journals/corr/HarrisonER17}. However, the use of rationales in this work is quite different from the role they play in most prior work, where interpretation models are trained to generate plausible sounding (but not necessarily accurate) post-hoc descriptions of the decision making process they used. In this work, the rationale is generated as a latent variable that gives rise to the answer---it is thus a more faithful representation of the steps used in computing the answer.\n\nThis paper makes three contributions. First, we have created a new dataset with more than 100,000 algebraic word problems that includes both answers and natural language answer rationales (\\S\\ref{sec:dataset}). Figure~\\ref{fig:examples} illustrates three representative instances from the dataset. Second, we propose a sequence to sequence model that generates a sequence of instructions that, when executed, generates the rationale; only after this is the answer chosen (\\S\\ref{sec:model}). Since the target program is not given in the training data (most obviously, its specific form will depend on the operations that are supported by the program interpreter); the third contribution is thus a technique for inferring programs that generate a rationale and, ultimately, the answer. Even constrained by a text rationale, the search space of possible programs is quite large, and we employ a heuristic search to find plausible next steps to guide the search for programs (\\S\\ref{sec:program_induction}). Empirically, we are able to show that state-of-the-art sequence to sequence models are unable to perform above chance on this task, but that our model doubles the accuracy of the baseline~(\\S\\ref{sec:exp}).\n\n\\section{Dataset}\n\\label{sec:dataset}\nWe built a dataset\\footnote{Available at \\url{https://github.com/deepmind/AQuA}} with 100,000 problems with the annotations shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:examples}. \nEach question is decomposed in four parts, two inputs and two outputs: the description of the problem, which we will denote as the \\textbf{question}, and the possible (multiple choice) answer options, denoted as \\textbf{options}. Our goal is to generate the description of the rationale used to reach the correct answer, denoted as \\textbf{rationale} and the \\textbf{correct option} label. Problem 1 illustrates an example of an algebra problem, which must be translated into an expression (i.e., $(27x + 17y) / (x + y) = 23$) and then the desired quantity $(x/y)$ solved for. Problem 2 is an example that could be solved by multi-step arithmetic operations proposed in~\\cite{Roy2015SolvingGA}. Finally, Problem 3 describes a problem that is solved by testing each of the options, which has not been addressed in the past. \n\n\\subsection{Construction}\nWe first collect a set of 34,202 seed problems that consist of multiple option math questions covering a broad range of topics and difficulty levels. Examples of exams with such problems include the GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) and GRE (General Test). Many websites contain example math questions in such exams, where the answer is supported by a rationale.\n\nNext, we turned to crowdsourcing to generate new questions. We create a task where users are presented with a set of 5 questions from our seed dataset. Then, we ask the Turker to choose one of the questions and write a similar question. We also force the answers and rationale to differ from the original question in order to avoid paraphrases of the original question. Once again, we manually check a subset of the jobs for each Turker for quality control. The type of questions generated using this method vary. Some turkers propose small changes in the values of the questions (e.g., changing the equality $p(a)-p(b)=p(a-b)$ in Problem~3 to a different equality is a valid question, as long as the rationale and options are rewritten to reflect the change). We designate these as replica problems as the natural language used in the question and rationales tend to be only minimally unaltered. Others propose new problems in the same topic where the generated questions tend to differ more radically from existing ones. Some Turkers also copy math problems available on the web, and we define in the instructions that this is not allowed, as it will generate multiple copies of the same problem in the dataset if two or more Turkers copy from the same resource. These Turkers can be detected by checking the nearest neighbours within the collected datasets as problems obtained from online resources are frequently submitted by more than one Turker. Using this method, we obtained 70,318 additional questions.\n\n\\subsection{Statistics}\n\nDescriptive statistics of the dataset is shown in Figure~\\ref{stats}. In total, we collected 104,519 problems (34,202 seed problems and 70,318 crowdsourced problems). We removed 500 problems as heldout set (250 for development and 250 for testing). As replicas of the heldout problems may be present in the training set, these were removed manually by listing for each heldout instance the closest problems in the training set in terms of character-based Levenstein distance. After filtering, 100,949 problems remained in the training set.\n\nWe also show the average number of tokens (total number of tokens in the question, options and rationale) and the vocabulary size of the questions and rationales. Finally, we provide the same statistics exclusively for tokens that are numeric values and tokens that are not.\n\nFigure~\\ref{histogram} shows the distribution of examples based on the total number of tokens. We can see that most examples consist of 30 to 500 tokens, but there are also extremely long examples with more than 1000 tokens in our dataset.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{} & \\textbf{Question} & \\textbf{Rationale} \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n\\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Training Examples} & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{100,949}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Dev Examples} & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{250}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Test Examples} & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{250}\\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n\\multirow{2}{*}{\\textbf{Numeric}}&Average Length& 9.6 & 16.6 \\\\\n&Vocab Size  & 21,009 & 14,745 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\multirow{2}{*}{\\textbf{Non-Numeric}}&Average Length  & 67.8 & 89.1 \\\\\n&Vocab Size & 17,849 & 25,034 \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n\\multirow{2}{*}{\\textbf{All}}&Average Length  & 77.4 & 105.7 \\\\\n&Vocab Size & 38,858 & 39,779 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Descriptive statistics of our dataset.}\\label{stats}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\columnwidth,scale=0.22,clip=false,trim=0cm 0cm\n    0cm 0cm]{images/length_hist2.pdf}}\n    \\vspace{-0.5cm}\n    \\caption{Distribution of examples per length.}\n    \\label{histogram}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Model}\n\\label{sec:model}\n\nGenerating rationales for math problems is challenging as it requires models that learn to perform math operations at a finer granularity as each step within the solution must be explained. For instance, in Problem 1, the equation $(27x + 17y) / (x + y) = 23$ must be solved to obtain the answer. In previous work~\\cite{kushman-EtAl:2014:P14-1}, this could be done by feeding the equation into an expression solver to obtain $x/y = 3/2$. However, this would skip the intermediate steps $27x + 17y = 23x + 23y$ and $4x = 6y$, which must also be generated in our problem. We propose a model that jointly learns to generate the text in the rationale, and to perform the math operations required to solve the problem. This is done by generating a program, containing both instructions that generate output and instructions that simply generate intermediate values used by following instructions.\n\n\\subsection{Problem Definition}\n\nIn traditional sequence to sequence models~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SutskeverVL14,DBLP:journals/corr/BahdanauCB14}, the goal is to predict the output sequence $\\boldsymbol{y}=y_1,\\ldots,y_{|\\boldsymbol{y}|}$ from the input sequence $\\boldsymbol{x}=x_1,\\ldots,x_{|\\boldsymbol{x}|}$, with lengths $|\\boldsymbol{y}|$ and $|\\boldsymbol{x}|$.\n\nIn our particular problem, we are given the problem and the set of options, and wish to predict the rationale and the correct option. We set $\\boldsymbol{x}$ as the sequence of words in the problem, concatenated with words in each of the options separated by a special tag. Note that knowledge about the possible options is required as some problems are solved by the process of elimination or by testing each of the options (e.g. Problem 3). We wish to generate $\\boldsymbol{y}$, which is the sequence of words in the rationale. We also append the correct option as the last word in $\\boldsymbol{y}$, which is interpreted as the chosen option. For example, $\\struct{y}$ in Problem 1 is ``Let the $\\ldots$ = 3/2 . $\\langle$EOR$\\rangle$ B $\\langle$EOS$\\rangle$\", whereas in Problem 2 it is ``Let s be $\\dots$ Answer is C $\\langle$EOR$\\rangle$ C $\\langle$EOS$\\rangle$\", where ``$\\langle$EOS$\\rangle$\" is the end of sentence symbol and ``$\\langle$EOR$\\rangle$\" is the end of rationale symbol.\n\n\\subsection{Generating Programs to Generate Rationales}\n\nWe wish to generate a latent sequence of \\textbf{program instructions}, $\\boldsymbol{z}=z_1,\\ldots,z_{|\\boldsymbol{z}|}$, with length ${|\\boldsymbol{z}|}$, that will generate $\\boldsymbol{y}$ when executed. %While many instructions will append output to $\\boldsymbol{y}$, this is not necessary; we also maintain a memory buffer $\\boldsymbol{m}$ that the program can write values to for later use.\n\nWe express $\\boldsymbol{z}$ as a program that can access $\\boldsymbol{x}$, $\\boldsymbol{y}$, and the memory buffer $\\boldsymbol{m}$. Upon finishing execution we expect that the sequence of output tokens to be placed in the output vector $\\boldsymbol{y}$.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}r|l|l|l|l@{}}\n\\toprule\n$i$ & $\\boldsymbol{x}$ & $\\boldsymbol{z}$ & $\\boldsymbol{v}$ & $\\boldsymbol{r}$\\\\\n\\midrule\n1 & From & {\\tt Id}(``Let\") & \\emph{Let} & $y_{1}$ \\\\\n2 & a & {\\tt Id}(``s\") & \\emph{s} & $y_{2}$ \\\\\n3 & pack & {\\tt Id}(``be\") & \\emph{be} & $y_{3}$ \\\\\n4 & of & {\\tt Id}(``the\") & \\emph{the} & $y_{4}$ \\\\\n5 & 52 & {\\tt Id}(``sample\") & \\emph{sample} & $y_{5}$ \\\\\n6 & cards & {\\tt Id}(``space\") & \\emph{space} & $y_{6}$ \\\\\n7 & , & {\\tt Id}(``.\") & \\emph{.} & $y_{7}$ \\\\\n8 & two & {\\tt Id}(``$\\backslash$n\") & \\emph{$\\backslash$n} & $y_{8}$ \\\\\n9 & cards & {\\tt Id}(``Then\") & \\emph{Then} & $y_{9}$ \\\\\n10 & are & {\\tt Id}(``n\") & \\emph{n} & $y_{10}$ \\\\\n11 & drawn & {\\tt Id}(``(\") & \\emph{(} & $y_{11}$ \\\\\n12 & together & {\\tt Id}(``s\") & \\emph{s} & $y_{12}$ \\\\\n13 & at & {\\tt Id}(``)\") & \\emph{)} & $y_{13}$ \\\\\n14 & random & {\\tt Id}(``=\") & \\emph{=} & $y_{14}$ \\\\\n15 & . & {\\tt Str\\_to\\_Float}($x_5$) & $\\boldsymbol{52}$ & $\\underline{m_{1}}$ \\\\\n16 & What & {\\tt Float\\_to\\_Str}($m_1$) & \\emph{52} & $y_{15}$ \\\\\n17 & is & {\\tt Id}(``C\") & \\emph{C} & $y_{16}$ \\\\\n18 & the & {\\tt Id}(``2\") & \\emph{2} & $y_{17}$ \\\\\n19 & probability & {\\tt Id}(``=\") & \\emph{=} & $y_{18}$ \\\\\n20 & of & {\\tt Str\\_to\\_Float}($y_{17}$) & $\\boldsymbol{2}$  & $\\underline{m_{2}}$ \\\\\n21 & both & {\\tt Choose}($m_1$,$m_2$) & $\\boldsymbol{1326}$ & $\\underline{m_{3}}$ \\\\\n22 & cards & {\\tt Float\\_to\\_Str}($m_3$) & \\emph{1326} & $y_{19}$ \\\\\n23 & being & {\\tt Id}(``E\") & \\emph{E} & $y_{20}$ \\\\\n24 & kings & {\\tt Id}(``=\") & \\emph{=} & $y_{21}$ \\\\\n25 & ? & {\\tt Id}(``event\") & \\emph{event} & $y_{22}$ \\\\\n26 & $<$O$>$ & {\\tt Id}(``of\") & \\emph{of} & $y_{23}$ \\\\\n27 & A) & {\\tt Id}(``getting\") & \\emph{getting} & $y_{24}$ \\\\\n28 & 2/1223 & {\\tt Id}(``2\") & \\emph{2} & $y_{25}$ \\\\\n29 & $<$O$>$ & {\\tt Id}(``kings\") & \\emph{kings} & $y_{26}$ \\\\\n30 & B) & {\\tt Id}(``out\") & \\emph{out} & $y_{27}$ \\\\\n31 & 1/122 & {\\tt Id}(``of\") & \\emph{of} & $y_{28}$\\\\\n\\ldots & \\ldots & \\ldots & \\ldots & \\ldots \\\\\n$|\\boldsymbol{z}|$& & {\\tt Id}(``$\\langle$EOS$\\rangle$\") & $\\langle$\\emph{EOS}$\\rangle$ & $y_{|\\boldsymbol{y}|}$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Example of a program $\\boldsymbol{z}$ that would generate the output $\\boldsymbol{y}$. In $\\boldsymbol{v}$, \\emph{italics} indicates string types; $\\boldsymbol{bold}$ indicates float types. Refer to \\S\\ref{sec:instr} for description of variable names.\\label{tab:code_example}}\n\\end{table}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:code_example} illustrates an example of a sequence of instructions that would generate an excerpt from Problem 2, where columns $\\boldsymbol{x}$, $\\boldsymbol{z}$, $\\boldsymbol{v}$, and $\\boldsymbol{r}$ denote the input sequence, the instruction sequence (program), the values of executing the instruction, and where each value $v_i$ is written (i.e., either to the output or to the memory). In this example, instructions from indexes 1 to 14 simply fill each position with the observed output $y_1,\\ldots,y_{14}$ with a string, where the \\texttt{Id} operation simply returns its parameter without applying any operation. As such, running this operation is analogous to generating a word by sampling from a softmax over a vocabulary. However, instruction $z_{15}$ reads the input word $x_5$, 52, and applies the operation \\texttt{Str\\_to\\_Float}, which converts the word 52 into a floating point number, and the same is done for instruction $z_{20}$, which reads a previously generated output word $y_{17}$. Unlike, instructions $z_{1},\\ldots,z_{14}$, these operations write to the external memory $\\boldsymbol{m}$, which stores intermediate values. \nA more sophisticated instruction---which shows some of the power of our model---is $z_{21}=\\texttt{Choose}(m_1, m_2) \\rightarrow m_3$ which evaluates ${m_1 \\choose m_2}$ and\nstores the result in $m_3$. \nThis process repeats until the model generates the end-of-sentence symbol. The last token of the program as said previously must generate the correct option value, from ``A\" to ``E\".\n\nBy training a model to generate instructions that can manipulate existing tokens, the model benefits from the additional expressiveness needed to solve math problems within the generation process. In total we define 22 different operations, 13 of which are frequently used operations when solving math problems. These are: \\texttt{Id}, \\texttt{Add}, \\texttt{Subtract}, \\texttt{Multiply}, \\texttt{Divide}, \\texttt{Power}, \\texttt{Log}, \\texttt{Sqrt}, \\texttt{Sine}, \\texttt{Cosine}, \\texttt{Tangent}, \\texttt{Factorial}, and \\texttt{Choose} (number of combinations). \nWe also provide 2 operations to convert between \\texttt{Radians} and \\texttt{Degrees}, as these are needed for the sine, cosine and tangent operations. There are 6 operations that convert floating point numbers into strings and vice-versa. These include the \\texttt{Str\\_to\\_Float} and \\texttt{Float\\_to\\_Str} operations described previously, as well as operations which convert between floating point numbers and fractions, since in many math problems the answers are in the form ``3/4\". For the same reason, an operation to convert between a floating point number and number grouped in thousands is also used (e.g. 1000000 to ``1,000,000'' or ``1.000.000\").  Finally, we define an operation (\\texttt{Check}) that given the input string, searches through the list of options and returns a string with the option index in \\{``A'', ``B'', ``C'', ``D'', ``E''\\}. If the input value does not match any of the options, or more than one option contains that value, it cannot be applied. For instance, in Problem 2, once the correct probability ``1/221\" is generated, by applying the check operation to this number we can obtain correct option ``C\".\n\n\\subsection{Generating and Executing Instructions}\\label{sec:instr}\n\n\\ignore{\nIn a sequence to sequence model, we predict the probability of $\\boldsymbol{y}$ given $\\boldsymbol{x}$ as\n$\\log p(\\boldsymbol{y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{i} \\log p(y_i \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}_{<i}, \\boldsymbol{x})$, where\neach token $y_i$ is predicted conditioned on the previously generated\nsequence $\\boldsymbol{y}_{<i}$ and input sequence $\\boldsymbol{x}$. These probabilities are estimated with a\nsoftmax over the vocabulary $\\set{Y}$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\label{char_softmax}\np(y_i \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}_{<i}, \\boldsymbol{x}) = \\underset{y_i \\in \\set{Y}}\\softmax(\\mathbf{h}_i)\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_i$ is the decoder RNN state at\ntimestamp $i$, which is modeled as $g(y_{i-1},\\mathbf{h}_{i-1})$, and\n$g(\\cdot)$ is a recurrent update function, which generates the new state\n$\\mathbf{h}_i$ based on the previous token\n$y_{i-1}$ and the previous state $\\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$. In our work, we implement $g$ using a LSTM \\cite{Hochreiter:1997:LSM:1246443.1246450}. \nThe initial state of the decoder $\\mathbf{h}_0$ is the task state of the encoder, which is implemented as an LSTM chain over the input sequence $\\boldsymbol{x}$ with hidden states $\\mathbf{u}_0,\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{|x|}$.\n}\n\nIn our model, programs consist of sequences of instructions, $\\boldsymbol{z}$. We turn now to how we model each $z_i$, conditional on the text program specification, and the program's history. The instruction $z_i$ is a tuple consisting of an operation ($o_i$), an ordered sequence of its arguments ($\\boldsymbol{a}_i$), and a decision about where its results will be placed ($r_i)$ (is it appended in the output $\\boldsymbol{y}$ or in a memory buffer $\\boldsymbol{m}$?), and the result of applying the operation to its arguments ($v_i$). That is, $z_i=(o_i,r_i,\\boldsymbol{a}_{i},v_i)$. \n\nFormally, $o_i$ is an element of the pre-specified set of operations $\\mathcal{O}$, which contains, for example $\\texttt{add}$, $\\texttt{div}$, $\\texttt{Str\\_to\\_Float}$, etc. The number of arguments required by $o_i$ is given by $\\textit{argc}(o_i)$, e.g., $\\textit{argc}(\\texttt{add})=2$ and $\\textit{argc}(\\texttt{log})=1$. The arguments are $\\boldsymbol{a}_i = a_{i,1},\\ldots,a_{i,\\textit{argc}(o_i)}$. An instruction will generate a return value $v_i$ upon execution, which will either be placed in the output $\\boldsymbol{y}$ or hidden. This decision is controlled by $r_i$. We define the instruction probability as:\n\\begin{align*}\np(o_i,\\boldsymbol{a}_i, r_i, &v_i \\mid \\boldsymbol{z}_{<i}, \\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{m}) = \\\\\n&p(o_i \\mid \\boldsymbol{z}_{<i},\\boldsymbol{x}) \\times p(r_i \\mid \\boldsymbol{z}_{<i},\\boldsymbol{x},o_i) \\times \\\\\n& \\qquad \\prod_{j=1}^{\\textit{argc}(o_i)} p(a_{i,j} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z}_{<i},\\boldsymbol{x},o_i,\\boldsymbol{m},\\boldsymbol{y}) \\times \\\\\n&\\qquad [v_i = \\text{apply}(o_i,\\boldsymbol{a})],\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $[p]$ evaluates to 1 if $p$ is true and 0 otherwise, and $\\text{apply}(f,\\boldsymbol{x})$ evaluates the operation $f$ with arguments $\\boldsymbol{x}$. Note that the apply function is not learned, but pre-defined.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.277,clip=false,trim=1cm 3cm\n    1cm 5cm]{images/generation.pdf}\n    \\vspace{-.4cm}\\caption{Illustration of the generation process of a single instruction tuple at timestamp $i$.}\n    \\label{input_img}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe network used to generate an instruction at a given timestamp $i$ is illustrated in Figure~\\ref{input_img}. \nWe first use the recurrent state $\\mathbf{h}_i$ to generate $p(o_i\\mid \\boldsymbol{z}_{<i},\\boldsymbol{x})=\\underset{o_i \\in \\set{O}}\\softmax(\\mathbf{h}_i)$, using a softmax over the set of available operations $\\set{O}$.\n\nIn order to predict $r_i$, we generate a new hidden state $\\mathbf{r}_i$, which is a function of the current program context $\\mathbf{h}_i$, and an embedding of the current predicted operation, $o_i$. \nAs the output can either be placed in the memory  $\\boldsymbol{m}$ or the output $\\boldsymbol{y}$, we \ncompute the probability $p(r_i = \\textsc{output} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z}_{<i},\\boldsymbol{x},o_i)=\\sigma (\\mathbf{r}_{i} \\cdot \\vect{w}_r +b_r)$, where $\\sigma$ is the logistic \nsigmoid function. \nIf $r_i=\\textsc{output}$, $v_i$ is appended to the output $\\boldsymbol{y}$; otherwise it is appended to the memory $\\boldsymbol{m}$.\n\nOnce we generate $r_i$, we must predict \n$\\boldsymbol{a}_i$, the $\\textit{argc}(o_i)$-length sequence of arguments that operation $o_i$ requires.\nThe $j$th argument $a_{i,j}$ can be either generated from a softmax over the vocabulary, copied from the input vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$, or copied from previously generated values in the output $\\boldsymbol{y}$ or memory $\\boldsymbol{m}$. This decision is modeled using a \nlatent predictor network~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/LingGHKSWB16}, where the control over which method used to generate $a_{i,j}$ is governed by a latent variable $q_{i,j} \\in \\{\\textsc{softmax}, \\textsc{copy-input}, \\textsc{copy-output}\\}$.\nSimilar to when predicting $r_i$, \nin order to make this choice, \nwe also generate a new hidden state for each argument slot $j$,\ndenoted by $\\vect{q}_{i,j}$ with an LSTM, feeding the previous argument in at each time step, and initializing it with $\\mathbf{r}_i$ and by reading the predicted value of the output $r_i$.\n\\begin{itemizesquish}\n\\item If $q_{i,j} = \\textsc{softmax}$, $a_{i,j}$ is generated by sampling from a softmax over the vocabulary $\\set{Y}$,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\small\np(a_{i,j}&\\mid q_{i,j}=\\textsc{softmax})=\\underset{a_{i,j} \\in \\set{Y}}\\softmax(\\mathbf{q}_{i,j}).\n\\end{align*}\nThis corresponds to a case where a string is used as argument (e.g. $y_1$=``Let\"). \n\\item If $q_{i,j} = \\textsc{copy-input}$, $a_{i,j}$ is obtained by copying an element from the input vector with a pointer network~\\cite{NIPS2015_5866} over input words $x_1,\\ldots,x_{|\\boldsymbol{x}|}$, represented by their encoder LSTM state $\\mathbf{u}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{|\\boldsymbol{x}|}$. As such, we compute the probability distribution over input words as:\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{copy-mec}\np(a_{i,j} \\mid q_{i,j} =& \\textsc{copy-input}) = \\\\ \n&\\underset{a_{i,j} \\in x_1,\\ldots,x_{|\\boldsymbol{x}|}}\\softmax\\left(f(\\mathbf{u}_{a_{i,j}},\\mathbf{q}_{i,j})\\right)\\nonumber\n\\end{align}\nFunction $f$ computes the affinity of each token $x_{a_{i,j}}$ and the current\noutput context $\\mathbf{q}_{i,j}$. A common implementation of $f$, which we follow, is to apply a\nlinear projection from [$\\mathbf{u}_{a_{i,j}};\\mathbf{q}_{i,j}]$ into a fixed size vector (where $[\\mathbf{u};\\mathbf{v}]$ is vector concatenation), followed by a $\\tanh$ and a linear projection into a single value.\n\\item If $q_{i,j} = \\textsc{copy-output}$, the model copies from either the output $\\boldsymbol{y}$ or the memory $\\boldsymbol{m}$. This is equivalent to finding the instruction $z_i$, where the value was generated. Once again, we define a pointer network that points to the output instructions and define the distribution over previously generated instructions as:\n\\begin{align*}\np(a_{i,j} \\mid q_{i,j} =& \\textsc{copy-output}) =\\\\ \n&\\underset{a_{i,j} \\in z_1,\\ldots,z_{i-1}}\\softmax\\left(f(\\mathbf{h}_{a_{i,j}},\\mathbf{q}_{i,j})\\right)\n\\end{align*}\nHere, the affinity is computed using the decoder state $\\mathbf{h}_{a_{i,j}}$ and the current state $\\mathbf{q}_{i,j}$. \n\\end{itemizesquish}\n\nFinally, we embed the argument $a_{i,j}$\\footnote{\nThe embeddings of a given argument $a_{i,j}$ and the return value $v_{i}$ are obtained with a lookup table embedding and two flags indicating whether it is a string and whether it is a float. Furthermore, if the the value is a float we also add its numeric value as a feature. \n}\nand the state $\\mathbf{q}_{i,j}$ to generate the next state $\\mathbf{q}_{i,j+1}$. Once all arguments for $o_i$ are generated, the operation is executed to obtain $v_i$. \nThen, the embedding of $v_i$, the final state of the instruction $\\mathbf{q}_{i,|\\boldsymbol{a}_i|}$ and the previous state $\\mathbf{h}_i$ are used to generate the state at the next timestamp $\\mathbf{h}_{i+1}$.\n\n\\section{Inducing Programs while Learning}\n\\label{sec:program_induction}\n\nThe set of instructions $\\boldsymbol{z}$ that will generate $\\boldsymbol{y}$ is unobserved. Thus, given $\\boldsymbol{x}$ we optimize the marginal probability function:\n\n\\begin{align*}\np(\\boldsymbol{y}\\mid \\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{z} \\in \\set{Z}} p(\\boldsymbol{y}\\mid \\boldsymbol{z}) p(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{z} \\in \\set{Z}(y)} p(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $p(\\boldsymbol{y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})$ is the Kronecker delta function $\\delta_{e(\\boldsymbol{z}),\\boldsymbol{y}}$, which is 1 if the execution of $\\boldsymbol{z}$, denoted as $e(\\boldsymbol{z})$, generates $y$ and 0 otherwise. Thus, we can redefine $p(\\boldsymbol{y}|\\boldsymbol{x})$, the marginal over all programs $\\set{Z}$, as a marginal over programs that would generate $\\boldsymbol{y}$, defined as $\\set{Z}(\\boldsymbol{y})$. As marginalizing over $\\boldsymbol{z}\\in \\set{Z}(\\boldsymbol{y})$ is intractable, we approximate the marginal by generating samples from our model. Denote the set of samples that\nare generated by $\\hat{\\set{Z}}(\\boldsymbol{y})$. We maximize $\\sum{\\boldsymbol{z} \\in \\hat{\\set{Z}}(\\boldsymbol{y})} p(\\boldsymbol{z}|\\boldsymbol{x})$.\n\nHowever, generating programs that generate $\\boldsymbol{y}$ is not trivial, as randomly sampling from the RNN distribution over instructions at each timestamp is unlikely to generate a sequence $\\boldsymbol{z}\\in \\set{Z}(\\boldsymbol{y})$.\n\nThis is analogous to the question answering work in~\\newcite{DBLP:journals/corr/LiangBLFL16}, where the query that generates the correct answer must be found during inference, and training proved to be difficult without supervision. In~\\newcite{Roy2015SolvingGA} this problem is also addressed by adding prior knowledge to constrain the exponential space. \n\nIn our work, we leverage the fact that we are generating rationales, where there is a sense of progression within the rationale. That is, we assume that the rationale solves the problem step by step. For instance, in Problem 2, the rationale first describes the number of combinations of two cards in a deck of 52 cards, then describes the number of combinations of  two kings, and finally computes the probability of drawing two kings. Thus, while generating the final answer without the rationale requires a long sequence of latent instructions, generating each of the tokens of the rationale requires far less operations. \n\nMore formally, given the \nsequence $z_1,\\dots,z_{i-1}$ generated so far, and the possible values for $z_i$ \ngiven by the network, denoted $\\set{Z}_i$, \nwe wish to filter $\\set{Z}_i$ to $\\set{Z}_i(y_k)$, which denotes a set of possible options that contain at least one path capable of generating the next token at index $k$. Finding the set $\\set{Z}_i(y_k)$ is achieved by testing all combinations of instructions that are possible with at most one level of indirection, and keeping those that can generate $y_k$. This means that the model can only generate one intermediate value in memory (not including the operations that convert strings into floating point values and vice-versa). \n\n \n \\ignore{\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=1.5\\columnwidth,scale=0.22,clip=false,trim=0cm 0cm\n    0cm 0cm]{images/graph.png}}\n    \\caption{Example of the sampling process within space $Z(y)$.\n}\n    \\label{graph}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nSampling is performed by defining two sets of nodes $C$ \\dycomment{set}, whose values are accessible at the current timestamp. This set is initialized with the nodes representing the values in $\n\\struct{x}$. Every new instruction that is generated inserts the respective node in $C$\\dycomment{need a new notation that is not C because you already have $C^{10}_2$ and $C^{55}_2$ earlier in the section for choose, or replace that one with Choose(10,2) to be consistent with our notation in the previous section?. also use set}, and for every output token $y_k$ that is generated the respective initial state is also inserted as the generated results of these nodes become usable. Secondly, $B$ is the set of nodes that have not been used yet to generate the next output token, which is initialized as an empty set. At each timestamp $i$, the set of possible actions $Z_i(y_k)$ is the set of nodes $n_i$ so that:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item All predecessors of $n_i$ exist in $C$. That is, all the arguments used by $n_i$ have been generated.\n\\item There is a final node $n_j$ that generates $y_k$, so that there is a path between $n_i \\cup B$ and $n_j$. This guarantees that there is a way to generate $y_k$, which uses all nodes in $B$. \n\\end{itemize}\n\nAn illustration of the algorithm can be found in Figure~\\ref{graph}. Where initially at $i=1$, $C=n_1,\\ldots,n_5$\\dycomment{todo: change to set notation after deciding to change C or not} and the options to generate '63' are given in nodes $n_6$, $n_{15}$ and $n_{16}$, as each of these nodes have a path to one of the final nodes $n_6$, $n_{16}$ and $n_{21}$. The chosen option $n_{15}$ converts $x_5$ into a floating point number, which is saved in $a_1$. At $i=2$, $n_6$ and $n_21$ are no longer valid options as $n_{15}$ must be used to generate $y_k$. At $i=6$, the model must generate '42', which is obtained by subtracting 63 and 21. At this point, the floating point number 63, has been generated at timestamp $i=1$, but the model is allowed the value 63 from $n_{17}$, which is intended as this value could refer to a different quantity. However, once the model as generated the node $n_{23}$ at iteration $i=7$, the other options are no longer valid as they do not share the same final state $n_{27}$.\n\nUsing this method, we can guarantee that the model produces valid instructions $\\struct{z}$ during sampling. While generating graph $\\mathcal{G}$ is expensive as it requires millions of nodes to be generated, this process can be parallelized, and only need to be executed once per training sample, as the filtered graph can be stored.\n}\n\\paragraph{Decoding.}\nDuring decoding we find the most likely sequence of instructions $\\struct{z}$ given $\\struct{x}$, which can be performed with a stack-based decoder. However, it is important to refer that each generated instruction $z_i=(o_i,r_i,a_{i,1},\\ldots,a_{i,|a_{i}|},v_i)$ must be executed to obtain $v_i$. To avoid generating unexecutable code---e.g., log(0)---each hypothesis instruction is executed and removed if an error occurs. Finally, once the ``$\\langle$EOR$\\rangle$\" tag is generated, we only allow instructions that would generate one of the option ``A\" to ``E\" to be generated, which guarantees that one of the options is chosen.\n\n\\section{Staged Back-propagation}\nAs it is shown in Figure~\\ref{histogram}, math rationales with more than 200 tokens are not uncommon, and with additional intermediate instructions, the size $\\boldsymbol{z}$ can easily exceed 400. This poses a practical challenge for training the model.\n\nFor both the attention and copy mechanisms, for each instruction $z_i$, the model needs to compute the probability distribution between all the attendable units $\\boldsymbol{c}$ conditioned on the previous state $\\mathbf{h}_{i-1}$. For the attention model and input copy mechanisms, $\\boldsymbol{c}=\\boldsymbol{x_{0,i-1}}$ and for the output copy mechanism $\\boldsymbol{c}=\\boldsymbol{z}$. These operations generally involve an exponential number of matrix multiplications as the size of $\\boldsymbol{c}$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}$ grows. For instance, during the computation of the probabilities for the input copy mechanism in Equation~\\ref{copy-mec}, the affinity function $f$ between the current context $\\boldsymbol{q}$ and a given input $\\boldsymbol{u}_k$ is generally implemented by projecting $\\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\\boldsymbol{q}$ into a single vector followed by a non-linearity, which is projected into a single affinity value. Thus, for each possible input $\\boldsymbol{u}$, 3 matrix multiplications must be performed. Furthermore, for RNN unrolling, parameters and intermediate outputs for these operations must be replicated for each timestamp. Thus, as $\\boldsymbol{z}$ becomes larger the attention and copy mechanisms quickly become a memory bottleneck as the computation graph becomes too large to fit on the GPU. In contrast, the sequence-to-sequence model proposed in ~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SutskeverVL14}, does not suffer from these issues as each timestamp is dependent only on the previous state $\\mathbf{h}_{i-1}$.\n\nTo deal with this, we use a training method we call \\textbf{staged back-propagation} which saves memory by considering slices of $K$ tokens in $\\boldsymbol{z}$, rather than the full sequence. That is, to train on a mini-batch where $|z|=300$ with $K=100$, we would actually train on 3 mini-batches, where the first batch would optimize for the first $\\boldsymbol{z}_{1:100}$, the second for $\\boldsymbol{z}_{101:200}$ and the third for $\\boldsymbol{z}_{201:300}$. The advantage of this method is that memory intensive operations, such as attention and the copy mechanism, only need to be unrolled for $K$ steps, and $K$ can be adjusted so that the computation graph fits in memory. \n\nHowever, unlike truncated back-propagation for language modeling, where context outside the scope of $K$ is ignored, sequence-to-sequence models require global context. Thus, the sequence of states $\\boldsymbol{h}$ is still built for the whole sequence $\\boldsymbol{z}$. Afterwards, we obtain a slice $\\boldsymbol{h}_{j:j+K}$, and compute the attention vector.\\footnote{This modeling strategy is sometimes known as late fusion, as the attention vector is not used for state propagation, it is incorporated ``later''.} Finally, the prediction of the instruction is conditioned on the LSTM state and the attention vector.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:exp}\nWe apply our model to the task of generating rationales for solutions to math problems, evaluating it on both the quality of the rationale and the ability of the model to obtain correct answers. \n\n\\subsection{Baselines}\nAs the baseline we use the attention-based sequence to sequence model proposed by~\\newcite{DBLP:journals/corr/BahdanauCB14}, and proposed augmentations, allowing it to copy from the input~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/LingGHKSWB16} and from the output~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/MerityXBS16}.\n\n\\subsection{Hyperparameters}\nWe used a two-layer LSTM with a hidden size of $H=200$, and word embeddings with size 200. The number of levels that the graph $\\mathcal{G}$ is expanded during sampling $D$ is set to 5. Decoding is performed with a beam of 200. As for the vocabulary of the softmax and embeddings, we keep the most frequent 20,000 word types, and replace the rest of the words with an unknown token. During training, the model only learns to predict a word as an unknown token, when there is no other alternative to generate the word.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\n\nThe evaluation of the rationales is performed with average sentence level perplexity and BLEU-4~\\cite{Papineni:2002:BMA:1073083.1073135}. When a model cannot generate a token for perplexity computation, we predict unknown token. This benefits the baselines as they are less expressive. As the perplexity of our model is dependent on the latent program that is generated, we force decode our model to generate the rationale, while maximizing the probability of the program. This is analogous to the method used to obtain sample programs described in Section~\\ref{sec:program_induction}, but we choose the most likely instructions at each timestamp instead of sampling. Finally, the correctness of the answer is evaluated by computing the percentage of the questions, where the chosen option matches the correct one.\n\n\\subsection{Results}\n\nThe test set results, evaluated on perplexity, BLEU, and accuracy, are presented in Table~\\ref{tab:results}.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|}\n\\hline\nModel & Perplexity & BLEU & Accuracy\\\\\n\\hline\nSeq2Seq & 524.7 & 8.57 & 20.8\\\\\n+Copy Input & 46.8 & 21.3 & 20.4\\\\\n+Copy Output & 45.9 & 20.6 & 20.2\\\\\n\\hline\nOur Model & \\textbf{28.5} & \\textbf{27.2} & \\textbf{36.4}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Results over the test set measured in Perplexity, BLEU and Accuracy.}\\label{tab:results}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\paragraph{Perplexity.} In terms of perplexity, we observe that the regular sequence to sequence model fares poorly on this dataset, as the model requires the generation of many values that tend to be sparse. Adding an input copy mechanism greatly improves the perplexity as it allows the generation process to use values that were mentioned in the question. The output copying mechanism improves perplexity slightly over the input copy mechanism, as many values are repeated after their first occurrence. For instance, in Problem 2, the value ``1326\" is used twice, so even though the model cannot generate it easily in the first occurrence, the second one can simply be generated by copying the first one. We can observe that our model yields significant improvements over the baselines, demonstrating that the ability to generate new values by algebraic manipulation is essential in this task. An example of a program that is inferred is shown in Figure ~\\ref{example}. The graph was generated by finding the most likely program $\\boldsymbol{z}$ that generates $\\boldsymbol{y}$. Each node isolates a value in $\\boldsymbol{x}$, $\\boldsymbol{m}$, or $\\boldsymbol{y}$, where arrows indicate an operation executed with the outgoing nodes as arguments and incoming node as the return of the operation. For simplicity, operations that copy or convert values (e.g. from string to float) were not included, but nodes that were copied/converted share the same color. Examples of tokens where our model can obtain the perplexity reduction are the values ``0.025\", ``0.023\", ``0.002\" and finally the answer ``E\" , as these cannot be copied from the input or output. \n\n\\paragraph{BLEU.}\nWe observe that the regular sequence to sequence model achieves a low BLEU score. In fact, due to the high perplexities the model generates very short rationales, which frequently consist of segments similar to ``Answer should be D\", as most rationales end with similar statements. By applying the copy mechanism the BLEU score improves substantially, as the model can define the variables that are used in the rationale. Interestingly, the output copy mechanism adds no further improvement in the perplexity evaluation. This is because during decoding all values that can be copied from the output are values that could have been generated by the model either from the softmax or the input copy mechanism. As such, adding an output copying mechanism adds little to the expressiveness of the model during decoding.\n\nFinally, our model can achieve the highest BLEU score as it has the mechanism to generate the intermediate and final values in the rationale.\n\n\\paragraph{Accuracy.}\nIn terms of accuracy, we see that all baseline models obtain values close to chance (20\\%), indicating that they are completely unable to solve the problem. In contrast, we see that our model can solve problems at a rate that is significantly higher than chance, demonstrating the value of our program-driven approach, and its ability to learn to generate programs.\n\nIn general, the problems we solve correctly correspond to simple problems that can be solved in one or two operations. Examples include questions such as ``Billy cut up each cake into 10 slices, and ended up with 120 slices altogether. How many cakes did she cut up? A) 9 B) 7 C) 12 D) 14 E) 16\", which can be solved in a single step. In this case, our model predicts ``120 / 10 = 12 cakes. Answer is C\" as the rationale, which is reasonable.\n\n\\subsection{Discussion.}\nWhile we show that our model can outperform the models built up to date, generating complex rationales as those shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:examples} correctly is still an unsolved problem, as each additional step adds complexity to the problem both during inference and decoding. Yet, this is the first result showing that it is possible to solve math problems in such a manner, and we believe this modeling approach and dataset will drive work on this problem.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\vspace{-0.8cm}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/example.pdf}\n    \\vspace{-2cm}\\caption{Illustration of the most likely latent program inferred by our algorithm to explain a held-out question-rationale pair.}\n    \\label{example}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\section{Related Work}\nExtensive efforts have been made in the domain of math problem solving~\\cite{DBLP:conf/emnlp/HosseiniHEK14,kushman-EtAl:2014:P14-1,Roy2015SolvingGA}, which aim at obtaining the correct answer to a given math problem. Other work has focused on learning to map math expressions into formal languages~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/RoyUR16}. We aim to generate natural language rationales, where the bindings between variables and the problem solving approach are mixed into a single generative model that attempts to solve the problem while explaining the approach taken.\n\nOur approach is strongly tied with the work on sequence to sequence transduction using the encoder-decoder paradigm~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SutskeverVL14,DBLP:journals/corr/BahdanauCB14,kalchbrenner2013recurrent}, and inherits ideas from the extensive literature on semantic parsing~\\cite{Jones:2012:SPB:2390524.2390593,BerantCFL13,andreas-vlachos-clark:2013:Short,quirk:acl15,DBLP:journals/corr/LiangBLFL16,neelakantan:2016} and program generation~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/ReedF15,Graves_Nature2016}, namely, the usage of an external memory, the application of different operators over values in the memory and the copying of stored values into the output sequence. %\\newcite{DBLP:journals/corr/AndreasKL16} has also recently proposed to learn complex behavior from `policy sketches' that give a coarse overview of how an agent should behave but leaves details underspecified.\n\nProviding textual explanations for classification decisions has begun to receive attention, as part of increased interest in creating models whose decisions can be interpreted. \\newcite{lei:2016}, jointly modeled both a classification decision, and the selection of the most relevant subsection of a document for making the classification decision. % Their rationale\n\\newcite{hendricks:2016} generate textual explanations for visual classification problems, but in contrast to our model, they first generate an answer, and then, conditional on the answer, generate an explanation. This effectively creates a post-hoc justification for a classification decision rather than a program for deducing an answer. These papers, like ours, have jointly modeled rationales and answer predictions; however, we are the first to use rationales to guide program induction.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIn this work, we addressed the problem of generating rationales for math problems, where the task is to not only obtain the correct answer of the problem, but also generate a description of the method used to solve the problem. To this end, we collect 100,000 question and rationale pairs, and propose a model that can generate natural language and perform arithmetic operations in the same decoding process. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing neural models, in both the fluency of the rationales that are generated and the ability to solve the problem.\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 1>\n\n<paper 2>\n\\title{Measuring Massive Multitask\\\\Language Understanding}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\vspace{-35pt}\n\\begin{abstract}\nWe propose a new test to measure a text model's multitask accuracy. The test covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability. We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of recently proposed benchmarks. \nHowever, these models are still well below human level performance for language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the actual capabilities of these models. \nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark (GLUE) \\citep{wang2018glue} was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings of GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difficult tasks \\citep{wang2019superglue}. About a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level \\citep{raffel2019exploringT5}. While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language understanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning and everyday knowledge \\citep{zellers2019hellaswag,huang2019cosmosqa,bisk2019physicaliqa}. \nHowever, these recent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress \\citep{khashabi2020unifiedqa}. Overall, the near human-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets of language understanding.\n\nTransformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including all of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites. These models consequently see extensive information about specialized topics, most of which is not assessed by existing NLP benchmarks. \nIt consequently remains an open question just how capable current language models are at learning and applying knowledge from many domains.\n\nTo bridge the gap between the wide-ranging knowledge that models see during pretraining and the existing measures of success,\nwe introduce a new benchmark for assessing models across a diverse set of subjects that humans learn.\nWe design the benchmark to measure knowledge acquired during pretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This makes the benchmark more challenging and more similar to how we evaluate humans.\nThe benchmark covers $57$ subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. It ranges in difficulty from an elementary level to an advanced professional level, and it tests both world knowledge and problem solving ability.\nSubjects range from traditional areas, such as mathematics and history, to more specialized areas like law and ethics \\citep{hendrycks2020ethicsdataset}.\nThe granularity and breadth of the subjects makes the benchmark ideal for identifying a model's blind spots. \n\nWe find that meaningful progress on our benchmark has only become possible in recent months. In particular, few-shot models up to $13$ billion parameters \\citep{brown2020gpt3} achieve random chance performance of $25\\%$ accuracy, but the $175$ billion parameter GPT-3 model reaches a much higher $43.9\\%$ accuracy (see \\Cref{fig:juxtaposition}). \nOn the other hand, unlike human professionals GPT-3 does not excel at any single subject.\nInstead, we find that performance is lopsided, with GPT-3 having almost $70\\%$ accuracy for its best subject but near-random performance for several other subjects.\n\nOur results indicate that while recent advances have been impressive, state-of-the-art models still struggle at learning and applying knowledge from pretraining.\nThe tasks with near-random accuracy include calculation-heavy subjects such as physics and mathematics and subjects related to human values such as law and morality. \nThis second weakness is particularly concerning because it will be important for future models to have a strong understanding of what is legal and what is ethical. Worryingly, we also find that GPT-3 does not have an accurate sense of what it does or does not know since its average confidence can be up to $24\\%$ off from its actual accuracy.\nWe comprehensively evaluate the breadth and depth of a model's text understanding by covering numerous topics that humans are incentivized to learn.\nSince our test consists in $57$ tasks, it can be used to analyze aggregate properties of models across tasks and to track important shortcomings.\nThe test and code is available at \\href{https://github.com/hendrycks/test}{github.com/hendrycks/test}. % TODO: undo\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\vspace{-20pt}\n\\begin{subfigure}{.49\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/few_shot_explainer_line.pdf}\n\\caption{An example of few-shot learning and inference using GPT-3.

In the process, these models are exposed to information about a wide range of topics.\n\\citet{petroni2019languagemodelsasknowledgebase} found that recent models learn enough information from pretraining that they can serve as knowledge bases.\nHowever, no prior work has comprehensively measured the knowledge models have across many real-world domains. \n\nUntil recently, researchers primarily used fine-tuned models on downstream tasks \\citep{BERTDevlin2019}. However, larger pretrained models like GPT-3 \\citep{brown2020gpt3} have made it possible to achieve competitive performance without fine-tuning by using few-shot learning, which removes the need for a large fine-tuning set. With the advent of strong zero-shot and few-shot learning, it is now possible to curate a diverse set of tasks for evaluation and remove the possibility of models on ``spurious cues'' \\citep{geirhos2020shortcut,Hendrycks2019NaturalAE} in a dataset to achieve high performance.\n\n\\paragraph{Benchmarks.} \nMany recent benchmarks aim to assess a model's general world knowledge and basic reasoning ability by testing its ``commonsense.'' A number of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed in the past year, but recent models are already nearing human-level performance on several of these, including HellaSwag \\citep{zellers2019hellaswag}, Physical IQA \\citep{bisk2019physicaliqa}, and CosmosQA \\citep{huang2019cosmosqa}. By design, these datasets assess abilities that almost every child has. In contrast, we include harder specialized subjects that people must study to learn. \n\nSome researchers have suggested that the future of NLP evaluation should focus on Natural Language Generation (NLG) \\citep{zellers2020turingadvice}, an idea that reaches back to the Turing Test \\citep{Turing1990TuringTest}. However, NLG is notoriously difficult to evaluate and lacks a standard metric \\citep{Sai2020NLGSurvey}. Consequently, we instead create a simple-to-evaluate test that measures classification accuracy on multiple choice questions.\n\nWhile several question answering benchmarks exist, they are comparatively limited in scope. Most either cover easy topics like grade school subjects for which models can already achieve strong performance \\citep{Clark2018ARCAI2, khot2019qasc, OpenBookQA2018,Clark2019RegentsScienceExams}, or are focused on linguistic understanding in the form of reading comprehension \\citep{lai2017race, richardson-etal-2013-mctest}. In contrast, we include a wide range of difficult subjects that go far beyond linguistic understanding.\n\n\\section{A Multitask Test}\n\nWe create a massive multitask test consisting of multiple-choice questions from various branches of knowledge.\nThe test spans subjects in the humanities, social sciences, hard sciences, and other areas that are important for some people to learn. \nThere are $57$ tasks in total, \nwhich is also the number of Atari games \\citep{Bellemare2013Atari}, \nall of which are listed in \\Cref{app:fulllist}.\nThe questions in the dataset were manually collected by graduate and undergraduate students from freely available sources online. These include practice questions for tests such as the Graduate Record Examination and the United States Medical Licensing Examination. It also includes questions designed for undergraduate courses and questions designed for readers of Oxford University Press books. \nSome tasks cover a subject, like psychology, but at a specific level of difficulty, such as ``Elementary,'' ``High School,'' ``College,'' or ``Professional.''\nFor example, the ``Professional Psychology'' task draws on questions from freely available practice questions for the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology, while the ``High School Psychology'' task has questions like those from Advanced Placement Psychology examinations.\n\nWe collected $15908$ questions in total, which we split into a few-shot development set, a validation set, and a test set. The few-shot development set has $5$ questions per subject, the validation set may be used for selecting hyperparameters and is made of $1540$ questions, and the test set has $14079$ questions. Each subject contains $100$ test examples at the minimum, which is longer than most exams designed to assess people.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\vspace{-17pt}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/law_figure.pdf}\n    \\caption{This task requires understanding detailed and dissonant scenarios, applying appropriate legal precedents, and choosing the correct explanation. The green checkmark is the ground truth.}\n    \\label{fig:law}\n    \\vspace{-17pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\nHuman-level accuracy on this test varies. Unspecialized humans from Amazon Mechanical Turk obtain $34.5\\%$ accuracy on this test. Meanwhile, expert-level performance can be far higher. For example, real-world test-taker human accuracy at the 95th percentile is around $87\\%$ for US Medical Licensing Examinations, and these questions make up our ``Professional Medicine'' task. If we take the 95th percentile human test-taker accuracy for exams that build up our test, and if we make an educated guess when such information is unavailable, we then estimate that expert-level accuracy is approximately $89.8\\%$.\n\nSince our test aggregates different subjects and several levels of difficulty, we measure more than straightforward commonsense or narrow \\emph{linguistic} understanding. Instead, we measure arbitrary real-world \\emph{text} understanding.\nSince models are pretrained on the Internet, this enables us to test how well they can extract useful knowledge from massive corpora. Future models that use this test could be single models or a mixture of experts model.\nTo succeed at our test, future models should be well-rounded, possess extensive world knowledge, and develop expert-level problem solving ability.\nThese properties make the test likely to be an enduring and informative goalpost.\n\n\\subsection{Humanities}\nThe humanities is a group of disciplines that make use of qualitative analysis and analytic methods rather than scientific empirical methods. Branches of the humanities include law, philosophy, history, and so on (\\Cref{app:fulllist}). Mastering these subjects requires a variety of skills. For example, legal understanding requires knowledge of how to apply rules and standards to complex scenarios, and also provide answers with stipulations and explanations. We illustrate this in \\Cref{fig:law}.\nLegal understanding is also necessary for understanding and following rules and regulations, a necessary capability to constrain open-world machine learning models.\nFor philosophy, our questions cover concepts like logical fallacies, formal logic, and famous philosophical arguments. It also covers moral scenarios, including questions from the ETHICS dataset \\citep{hendrycks2020ethicsdataset} that test a model's understanding of normative statements through predicting widespread moral intuitions about diverse everyday scenarios. Finally, our history questions cover a wide range of time periods and geographical locations, including prehistory and other advanced subjects.\n\n\\subsection{Social Science}\nSocial science includes branches of knowledge that examine human behavior and society. Subject areas include economics, sociology, politics, geography, psychology, and so on. See \\Cref{fig:socsci} for an example question. Our economics questions include microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics, and cover different types of problems, including questions that require a mixture of world knowledge, qualitative reasoning, or quantitative reasoning.\nWe also include important but more esoteric topics such as security studies in order to test the boundaries of what is experienced and learned during pretraining.\nSocial science also includes psychology, a field that may be especially important for attaining a nuanced understanding of humans.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\vspace{-20pt}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/social_sciences_thin.pdf}\n    \\caption{Examples from the Microeconomics task. %and Security Studies social science tasks.\n    \\looseness=-1}\n    \\label{fig:socsci}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/stem.pdf}\n    \\caption{Examples from the Conceptual Physics and College Mathematics STEM tasks.\n    \\looseness=-1}\n    \\label{fig:stem}\n    \\vspace{-10pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)}\nSTEM subjects include physics, computer science, mathematics, and more. Two examples are shown in \\Cref{fig:stem}. Conceptual physics tests understanding of simple physics principles and may be thought of as a harder version of the physical commonsense benchmark Physical IQA \\citep{bisk2019physicaliqa}. We also test mathematical problem solving ability at various levels of difficulty, from the elementary to the college level.\nCollege mathematics questions, like those found on the GRE mathematics subject test, often require chains of reasoning and abstract knowledge. To encode mathematics expressions, we use LaTeX or symbols such as * and \\^{} for multiplication and exponentiation respectively. STEM subjects require knowledge of empirical methods, fluid intelligence, and procedural knowledge.\n\n\\subsection{Other}\nThere is a long tail of subjects that either do not neatly fit into any of the three preceding categories or for which there are not thousands of freely available questions. We put these subjects into Other.\nThis section includes the Professional Medicine task, which has difficult questions that require humans many years of study to master.\nAn example is depicted in \\Cref{fig:other}.\nThis section also contains business topics like finance, accounting, and marketing, as well as knowledge of global facts. The latter includes statistics about poverty in different countries over time, which may be necessary for having an accurate model of the world internationally.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\vspace{-15pt}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/medicine_figure.pdf}\n    \\caption{A question from the Professional Medicine task.% which is a simulated question from the United States Medical Licensing Examination.\n    }\n    \\label{fig:other}\n    \\vspace{-15pt}\n\\end{figure}\\section{Experiments}\n\n\\begin{table}[b]\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{9pt}\n\\vspace{-5pt}\n\\fontsize{10}{11}\\selectfont\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc|c}\nModel       & Humanities & Social Science & STEM & Other &  Average \\\\\n\\hline\nRandom Baseline & 25.0 & 25.0 & 25.0 & 25.0 & 25.0 \\\\\nRoBERTa           & 27.9 & 28.8 & 27.0 & 27.7 & 27.9 \\\\\nALBERT           & 27.2 & 25.7 & 27.7 & 27.9 & 27.1 \\\\\nGPT-2           & 32.8 & 33.3 & 30.2 & 33.1 & 32.4 \\\\\nUnifiedQA       & 45.6 & 56.6 & 40.2 & 54.6 & 48.9 \\\\\nGPT-3 Small (few-shot)     & 24.4 & 30.9 & 26.0 & 24.1 & 25.9 \\\\\nGPT-3 Medium (few-shot)   & 26.1 & 21.6 & 25.6 & 25.5 & 24.9 \\\\\nGPT-3 Large (few-shot)     & 27.1 & 25.6 & 24.3 & 26.5 & 26.0 \\\\\nGPT-3 X-Large (few-shot)   & 40.8 & 50.4 & 36.7 & 48.8 & 43.9 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Average weighted accuracy for each model on all four broad disciplines.

We evaluate GPT-3 \\citep{brown2020gpt3} and UnifiedQA \\citep{khashabi2020unifiedqa}.\nFor GPT-3 we use the OpenAI API, which provides access to four model variants,  ``Ada,'' ``Babbage,'' ``Curie,'' and ``Davinci,'' which we refer to as ``Small'' ($2.7$ billion parameters), ``Medium'' ($6.7$ billion), ``Large'' ($13$ billion) and ``X-Large'' ($175$ billion). \nUnifiedQA uses the T5 \\citep{raffel2019exploringT5} text-to-text backbone and is fine-tuned on previously proposed question answering datasets \\citep{lai2017race}, where the prediction is the class with the highest token overlap with UnifiedQA's text output. Since UnifiedQA is fine-tuned on other datasets, we evaluate it without any further tuning to assess its transfer accuracy. We also fine-tune RoBERTa-base, ALBERT-xxlarge, and GPT-2 on UnifiedQA training data and our dev+val set. We primarily focus on UnifiedQA and GPT-3 in the rest of this document, but additional discussion of RoBERTa, ALBERT, and GPT-2 is in \\Cref{app:additional}.\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\\textwidth}\n\t\\vspace{-5pt}\n\t\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figures/merged_results.pdf}\n\t\\end{center}\n\t\\vspace{-10pt}\n\t\\caption{\n\tGPT-3 (few-shot) and UnifiedQA results.\n    }\\label{fig:fullresults}\n\t\\vspace{-50pt}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\n\n\\paragraph{Few-Shot Prompt.} We feed GPT-3 prompts like that shown in \\Cref{fig:fewshot}. We begin each prompt with ``The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about [subject].'' For zero-shot evaluation, we append the question to the prompt. For few-shot evaluation, we add up to $5$ demonstration examples with answers to the prompt before appending the question. All prompts end with ``Answer: ''. The model then produces probabilities for the tokens ``A,'' ``B,'' ``C,'' and ``D,'' and we treat the highest probability option as the prediction. %For most subjects, we could add exactly $5$ demonstrations per example, but for a few subjects with long questions we only added as many demonstrations as could fit in the context window of $2048$ tokens.\nFor consistent evaluation, we create a dev set with $5$ fixed few-shot examples for each subject.\n\n\\subsection{Results}\n\n\\paragraph{Model Size and Accuracy.}\n\nWe compare the few-shot accuracy of each GPT-3 size in \\Cref{tab:mainresults}. We find that the three smaller GPT-3 models have near random accuracy (around $25\\%$). %We also assess the $11$ billion parameter T5 model in a few-shot setting and confirmed that it likewise has random chance accuracy.\nIn contrast, we find that the X-Large $175$ billion parameter GPT-3 model performs substantially better than random, with an accuracy of $43.9\\%$. We also find qualitatively similar results in the zero-shot setting. While the smaller models have around $25\\%$ zero-shot accuracy, \\Cref{fig:kandacc} in \\Cref{app:additional} shows that the largest GPT-3 model has a much higher zero-shot accuracy of about $37.7\\%$. \\citet{brown2020gpt3} also observe that larger GPT-3 models perform better, though progress tends to be steadier. In \\Cref{fig:juxtaposition} we show that non-random accuracy on the multitask test emerged with recent large few-shot models compared to datasets that assess commonsense and linguistic understanding.\n\nTo test the usefulness of fine-tuning instead of few-shot learning, we also evaluate UnifiedQA models. \nUnifiedQA has the advantage of being fine-tuned on other question answering datasets, unlike GPT-3. We assess UnifiedQA \nby evaluating its transfer performance without any additional fine-tuning. The largest UnifiedQA model we test has $11$ billion parameters, which is slightly smaller than GPT-3 Large. Nevertheless, we show in \\Cref{tab:mainresults} that it attains $48.9\\%$ accuracy. This performs better than the few-shot GPT-3 X-Large model, despite UnifiedQA have an order of magnitude fewer parameters. We also find that even the smallest UnifiedQA variant, with just $60$ million parameters, has approximately $29.3\\%$ accuracy.\nThese results suggest that while model size is a key component for achieving strong performance, fine-tuning also helps.% is not the only important factor.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Comparing Disciplines.}\\quad\nUsing our test, we discover that GPT-3 and UnifiedQA have lopsided performance and several substantial knowledge gaps. \\Cref{fig:fullresults} shows the accuracy of GPT-3 (few-shot) and UnifiedQA for all $57$ tasks. It shows the both models are below expert-level performance for all tasks, with GPT-3's accuracy ranging from $69\\%$ for US Foreign Policy to $26\\%$ for College Chemistry. UnifiedQA does best on marketing, with an accuracy of $82.5\\%$.\n\nOverall, models do poorly on highly procedural problems.\n\\Cref{fig:fullresults} shows that calculation-heavy STEM subjects tend to have low accuracy compared to verbal subjects.\nFor GPT-3, $9$ out of the $10$ lowest-accuracy tasks are STEM subjects that emphasize mathematics or calculations.\nWe speculate that is in part because GPT-3 acquires declarative knowledge more readily than procedural knowledge. For example, many questions in Elementary Mathematics require applying the order of operations for arithmetic, which is described by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction). In \\Cref{fig:pemdas}, we confirm that GPT-3 is \\emph{aware} of the acronym PEMDAS. However, it does not consistently \\emph{apply} PEMDAS to actual problems. \nOn the other hand, procedural understanding is not its only weak point. We find that some verbal tasks such as Moral Scenarios from \\cite{hendrycks2020ethicsdataset} and Professional Law also have especially low accuracy.\n\nOur test also shows that GPT-3 acquires knowledge quite unlike humans. For example, GPT-3 learns about topics in a pedagogically unusual order.\nGPT-3 does better on College Medicine ($47.4\\%$) and College Mathematics ($35.0\\%$) than calculation-heavy Elementary Mathematics ($29.9\\%$). GPT-3 demonstrates unusual breadth, but it does not master a single subject. Meanhwhile we suspect humans have mastery in several subjects but not as much breadth. In this way, our test shows that GPT-3 has many knowledge blindspots and has capabilities that are lopsided.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\vspace{-20pt}\n\\begin{minipage}{.5\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/pemdas.pdf}\n\\caption{GPT-3's completion for two prompts testing knowledge of the order of operations.\nThe \\textcolor{rightblue}{blue} underlined bold text is the autocompleted response from GPT-3.\nWhile it \\emph{knows about} the order of operations, it sometimes does not \\emph{know how} to apply its knowledge.\\looseness=-1}\\label{fig:pemdas}\n\\end{minipage}%\n\\begin{minipage}{.5\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/calibration_arrows.pdf}\n\\caption{\nGPT-3's confidence is a poor estimator of its accuracy and can be off by up to $24\\%$.\\looseness=-1\n}\\label{fig:calibration}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\vspace{-15pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Calibration.}\\quad\nWe should not trust a model's prediction unless the model is calibrated, meaning that its confidence is a good estimate of the actual probability the prediction is correct. However, large neural networks are often miscalibrated \\citep{kilian2017calibration}, especially under distribution shift \\citep{ovadia2019can}. \nWe evaluate the calibration of GPT-3 by testing how well its average confidence estimates its actual accuracy for each subject.\nWe show the results in \\Cref{fig:calibration}, which demonstrates that GPT-3 is uncalibrated. In fact, its confidence is only weakly related to its actual accuracy in the zero-shot setting, with the difference between its accuracy and confidence reaching up to $24\\%$ for some subjects.\nAnother calibration measure is the Root Mean Squared (RMS) calibration error \\citep{hendrycks2019oe,kumar2019verifiedcalibration}. Many tasks have miscalibrated predictions, such as Elementary Mathematics which has a zero-shot RMS calibration error of 19.4\\%. Models are only somewhat more calibrated in the few-shot setting, as shown in \\Cref{app:additional}.\nThese results suggest that model calibration has wide room for improvement.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Multimodal Understanding.}\\quad\nWhile text is capable of conveying an enormous number of concepts about the world, many important concepts are conveyed mainly through other modalities, such as images, audio, and physical interaction \\citep{bisk2020experiencegroundslang}. Existing large-scale NLP models, such as GPT-3, do not incorporate multimodal information, so we design our benchmark to capture a diverse array of tasks in a text-only format. However, as models gain the ability to process multimodal inputs, benchmarks should be designed to reflect this change. One such benchmark could be a ``Turk Test,'' consisting of Amazon Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks. These are well-defined tasks that require models to interact with flexible formats and demonstrate multimodal understanding.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{The Internet as a Training Set.}\\quad\nA major distinction between our benchmark and previous multitask NLP benchmarks is that we do not require large training sets. Instead, we assume that models have acquired the requisite knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the Internet. This process is typically called pretraining, but it can be thought of as training in its own right, where the downstream evaluation is demonstrating whatever knowledge we would expect a human to pick up from reading the same text. \n\nThis motivates us to propose a methodological change so that models are trained more like how humans learn.\nWhile most previous machine learning benchmarks have models learn from a large question bank, humans primarily learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk about the topic. For specialized subjects such as Professional Law, massive legal corpora are available, such as the 164-volume legal encyclopedia \\emph{Corpus Juris Secundum}, but there are fewer than 5,000 multistate bar exam questions available. Learning the entire law exclusively through a small number of practice tests is implausible, so future models must learn more during pretraining. \n\nFor this reason we assess pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting and we provide a dev, val, and test set for each task. The dev set is used for few-shot prompts, the val set could be used for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set is used to compute the final accuracy. Importantly, the format of our evaluation is not identical to the format in which information is acquired during pretraining. This has the benefit of obviating concerns about spurious training set annotation artifacts \\citep{geirhos2020shortcut,Hendrycks2019NaturalAE} and is in stark contrast to the previous paradigm of identically distributed training and test sets. \nThis change also enables collecting a much more extensive and diverse set of tasks for evaluation.\nWe anticipate our methodology becoming more widespread as models improve at extracting information from diverse online sources.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Model Limitations.}\\quad\nWe find that current large-scale Transformers have wide room for improvement. They are notably poor at modeling human (dis)approval, as evident by the low performance on the Professional Law and Moral Scenarios tasks. For future systems to be aligned with human values, high performance on these tasks is crucial \\citep{hendrycks2020ethicsdataset}, so future research should especially aim to increase accuracy on these tasks. Models also have difficulty performing calculations, so much so that they exhibit poor performance on Elementary Mathematics and many other STEM subjects with ``plug and chug'' problems. Additionally, they do not match expert-level performance (90\\%) on any subject, so for all subjects it is subhuman. On average, models are only now starting to move beyond random-chance accuracy levels.\n\nAddressing these shortcomings may be challenging. To illustrate this, we attempted to create a better Professional Law model by pretraining on specialized data but achieved only limited success. We collected approximately 2,000 additional Professional Law training examples. After fine-tuning a RoBERTa-base model \\citep{RobertaLiu2019AR} using this custom training set, our model attained $32.8\\%$ test accuracy. To test the impact of additional specialized training data, we also had RoBERTa continue pretraining on approximately 1.6 million legal case summaries using Harvard’s Law Library case law corpus \\texttt{case.law}, but after fine-tuning it only attained $36.1\\%$ accuracy. This suggests that while additional pretraining on relevant high quality text can help, it may not be enough to substantially increase the performance of current models. \n\nIt is unclear whether simply scaling up existing language models will solve the test. Current understanding indicates that a $10\\times$ increase in model size must be accompanied by an approximate $5\\times$ increase in data \\citep{kaplan2020scalinglaws}. Aside from the tremendous expense in creating multi-trillion parameter language models, data may also become a bottleneck, as there is far less written about esoteric branches of knowledge than about everyday situations.\n\nWe introduced a new test that measures how well text models can learn and apply knowledge encountered during pretraining. By covering 57 subjects at varying levels of difficulty, the test assesses language understanding in greater breadth and depth than previous benchmarks.\nWe found that it has recently become possible for models to make meaningful progress on the test, but that state-of-the-art models have lopsided performance and rarely excel at any individual task. We also showed that current models are uncalibrated and have difficulty with tasks that require calculations. Worryingly, models also perform especially poorly on socially relevant subjects including morality and law.\nOur expansive test can help researchers pinpoint important shortcomings of models, making it easier to gain a clearer picture of state-of-the-art capabilities.\\looseness=-1\n\n\\newpage\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nWe would like to thank the following for their helpful comments: Oyvind Tafjord, Jan Leike, David Krueger, Alex Tamkin, Girish Sastry, and Henry Zhu.

To diagnose the failures of current models and support research, we introduce GSM8K, a dataset of 8.5K high quality linguistically diverse grade school math word problems. We find that even the largest transformer models fail to achieve high test performance, despite the conceptual simplicity of this problem distribution. To increase performance, we propose training verifiers to judge the correctness of model completions. At test time, we generate many candidate solutions and select the one ranked highest by the verifier. We demonstrate that verification significantly improves performance on GSM8K, and we provide strong empirical evidence that verification scales more effectively with increased data than a finetuning baseline.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nIn recent years, large language models have demonstrated impressive skills across many diverse tasks \\citep{wang2019superglue, brown2020language}. \\cite{kaplan2020scaling} describe the consistent benefits of increasing model size, characterizing scaling trends that hold across many orders of magnitude. However, even the largest models falter when required to perform multi-step mathematical reasoning \\citep{hendrycks2021measuring}. Model samples frequently contain catastrophic mistakes, even after the model has been appropriately finetuned. Mathematical reasoning thus reveals a critical weakness in modern language models.\n\nOne significant challenge in mathematical reasoning is the high sensitivity to individual mistakes \\citep{shen2021generate}. When generating a solution, autoregressive models have no mechanism to correct their own errors. Solutions that veer off-course quickly become unrecoverable. If we rely purely on generative methods and extrapolate from current trends, we will require an exorbitant parameter count to achieve even moderate performance on distributions as challenging as the MATH dataset \\citep{hendrycks2021measuring}. This evidence strongly motivates the search for methods with more favorable scaling laws.\n\nWe propose training verifiers to evaluate the correctness of model generated solutions, similar to concurrent work by \\cite{shen2021generate}. At test time, we sample a fixed number of candidate solutions and select the solution ranked highest by the verifier. Verifiers benefit both from their inherent optionality and from verification being a simpler task than generation in general.\n\nTo facilitate research, we are releasing GSM8K, a dataset of 8.5K high quality problems at the grade school math level. We designed this dataset to have high linguistic diversity while relying on relatively simple grade school math concepts. State-of-the-art language models struggle to achieve high performance on this dataset, primarily due to the high diversity among problems. At the same time, GSM8K solutions depend only on elementary concepts, so achieving high test performance is a tractable goal.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/example_problems.png}\n\\caption{Three example problems from GSM8K. Calculation annotations are highlighted in red.}\n\\label{fig:dataset_examples}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item We present a curated dataset of 8.5K grade school math questions and natural language solutions, useful for probing the informal reasoning ability of large language models.\n\n\\item We show that, compared to a finetuning baseline, the use of verifiers results in approximately the same performance boost as a 30x model size increase, and that verifiers scale significantly better with increased data.\n\n\\item We show that dropout acts as a strong regularizer, significantly improving performance for both finetuning and verification.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{Dataset} \\label{section:dataset}\n\nGSM8K consists of 8.5K high quality grade school math problems created by human problem writers. We segmented these into 7.5K training problems and 1K test problems. These problems take between 2 and 8 steps to solve, and solutions primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations ($+ - \\times \\div$) to reach the final answer. A bright middle school student should be able to solve every problem.\n\nWe created GSM8K based on the following design principles.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{High Quality} We avoid error-prone scraping procedures and instead rely on human workers to create problems. After performing extensive quality control based on workers' answer agreement, we estimate that less than 2 percent of problems contain breaking errors.\n    \\item \\textbf{High Diversity} We strive for high diversity among problems. We actively avoid designing problems that are drawn from the same linguistic template or differ only in superficial details, an issue that is prevalent among many other datasets. By creating each individual problem to be relatively unique, held-out test performance becomes a far more relevant metric.\n    \\item \\textbf{Moderate Difficulty} We choose a problem distribution that is challenging for large state-of-the-art language models, without being completely intractable. GSM8K will help us better understand the data scaling trends of different models and methods in this difficulty sweet spot. Problems require no concepts beyond the level of early Algebra, and the vast majority of problems can be solved without explicitly defining a variable.\n    \\item \\textbf{Natural Language Solutions} We collect solutions in natural language rather than as pure math expressions. We believe this is the most generally useful data format, and we expect it to shed light on the properties of large language models’ internal monologues. We instructed problem writers to explain their work as much as possible, but we allowed them to write solutions in their own diverse linguistic styles. \n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe full GSM8K dataset can be found at \\href{https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math}{https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math}. Example problems are shown in \\Cref{fig:dataset_examples}, and we discuss additional dataset details in \\Cref{appendix:dataset_details}.\n\n\\section{Related Work} \\label{section:related}\n\n\\subsection{Related Datasets} \n\nEarly math word problem datasets \\citep{kushman2014learning, roy-roth-2015-solving} are relatively small and are not well suited for testing the limits of modern language models. Dolphin18K \\citep{huang2016well} is a larger dataset containing 18K problems, but solutions are provided only in the form of equations or final answers. AQuA-RAT \\citep{ling2017program} contains 100K problems, but this dataset unfortunately suffers from both a high degree of problem templatization and poor quality control of the natural language solutions. MathQA is a recently released subset of AQuA-RAT focused on correcting these mistakes \\citep{amini2019mathqa}, but even the corrected dataset has data quality issues, with around 30\\% of the data having inconsistencies \\citep{miao2021diverse}. Ape210K \\citep{zhao2020ape210k} is the largest publicly available dataset, consisting of 210K Chinese elementary school-level math problems. However, due to the language barrier and the lack of natural language solutions, we're unable to evaluate our methods on this dataset.\n\nThe recently developed ASDiv dataset \\citep{miao2021diverse}, which contains 2.3K math word problems, addresses common flaws in prior datasets by ensuring problems have both high diversity and high quality. We share those design principles in the creation of GSM8K. However, we note that GSM8K is larger, provides natural language solutions, and consists of problems that on average require more steps to solve. The MATH dataset \\citep{hendrycks2021measuring} is larger and significantly more complex than GSM8K, but the high difficulty makes it challenging to accurately measure progress given the current capabilities of state-of-the-art language models.\n\nOther recent reasoning-related datasets have focused on mathematical reasoning on symbolic math \\citep{lample2019deep}, reading comprehension (LogiQA) \\citep{Liu2020LogiQAAC}, and commonsense question answering (CommonsenseQA) \\citep{talmor2018commonsenseqa}. Similar to CommonsenseQA, GSM8K includes questions that require basic background knowledge, like the number of days in a week. Similar to LogiQA, which requires a mix of reading comprehension and logical reasoning, GSM8K's main difficulty lies in both properly interpreting a question and reasoning through the steps to solve it.\n\n\\subsection{Related Methods}\n\nPrevious work has attempted to solve classic math word problem benchmarks with recurrent seq2seq models \\citep{sutskever2014sequence} and closely related variants \\citep{wang-etal-2017-deep, huang2018neural}. More recent work has improved performance by designing specialized encoder-decoder architectures \\citep{amini2019mathqa, chiang2018semantically, Xie2019AGT, Chen2020MappingNP, li2020graph}, with the strongest results often relying on large pretrained encoders from the BERT family \\citep{chen2019neural, kim2020point, mwpbert}.\n\nOther recent work has recommended additional pretraining tasks to further improve the math reasoning skills of large transformer-based models. \\cite{hendrycks2021measuring} propose pretraining models on a new AMPS corpus, derived from Khan Academy problems and Mathematica scripts. Similarly, \\cite{shen2021mathbert} propose a pretrained a corpus of pre-K to college level curricula extracted from the internet, and \\cite{Peng2021MathBERTAP} propose pretraining by predicting masked subexpressions from expression trees.\n\nSimilar to verification, other methods have finetuned a language model to select among many model completions. \\cite{nichols2020collaborative} proposed a sample-and-rank approach to improve the collaborative storytelling ability of large language models, with the training signal coming from the preferences of human workers. In concurrent work closely related to our own, \\cite{shen2021generate} applied a similar approach to solving math word problems, jointly training a model to both generate and rank solutions. Our work shares many fundamental similarities with their approach, though we differ in several key respects. First, we focus attention on the space of natural language solutions, as this is a richer and more general solution format than pure mathematical expressions. Moreover, this choice enables our models to develop verbal analytical skills and to produce solutions that are more readily interpretable by humans. Second, we provide evidence that verifiers scale far more favorably with additional data than baseline methods. Finally, we use separate generator and verifier networks, in order to prevent the generator from overfitting.\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.475 \\textwidth]{figures/bc.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.475 \\textwidth]{figures/bc_data.pdf}\n\\caption{Final test performance for various GPT-3 model sizes after finetuning on training sets of different sizes. Mean and standard deviation is shown across 3 runs.}\n\\label{fig:bc_baseline}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe investigate two methods to solve problems in GSM8K: finetuning and verification. Finetuning, our baseline method, uses the same language modeling objective as the generative pretraining in GPT-3 \\citep{brown2020language}. At test time, we judge performance by autoregressively sampling a single low temperature solution and checking whether the final answer is correct. In contrast, verification consists of sampling multiple high temperature solutions, assigning each solution a score, and outputting the highest ranked solution. Verifiers are trained to judge the correctness of solutions, with the training signal determined solely by whether or not the solution reached the correct final answer.\n\nFor both methods, we use models from the GPT-3 family as our initialization, primarily focusing on the 175B and 6B model sizes. The 175B model is the largest and produces the most impressive results, while the 6B model is significantly more convenient for research purposes. We discuss hyperparameter choices in \\Cref{appendix:hyperparameters}.\n\nOur models frequently fail to accurately perform calculations. Although larger models make fewer arithmetic mistakes than smaller models, this remains a common source of errors. To mitigate this issue, we train all models to use a calculator by injecting calculation annotations into the training set. At test time, a calculator will override sampling when the model chooses to use these annotations. Details can be found in \\Cref{appendix:calculator_annotations}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.475 \\textwidth]{figures/bc_training.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.475 \\textwidth]{figures/bc100_training.pdf}\n\\caption{Test solve rate after finetuning a 6B model on the full GSM8K training set, when the model is allowed to make 1 guess (left) or 100 guesses (right).}\n\\label{fig:bc_training}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsection{Finetuning}\n\nWe perform finetuning by updating model parameters to minimize the cross-entropy loss over all training tokens. \\Cref{fig:bc_baseline} shows test performance after finetuning on training sets of varying sizes for 20 epochs. We visualize the same data both as a function of training set size and as a function of model size. Test performance is determined by a single low temperature ($T=0$) sample for each test problem. Unsurprisingly, we see that the 175B model significantly outperforms the smaller models. Assuming a log-linear trend, we can naively extrapolate these results to estimate that a model with $10^{16}$ parameters would be required to reach an $80\\%$ solve rate, when using the full GSM8K training set. It is even harder to extrapolate along the data dimension, since performance does not appear to follow a log-linear trend. Nevertheless, it appears likely that the 175B model would require at least two additional orders of magnitude of training data to reach an $80\\%$ solve rate.\n\nIn \\Cref{fig:bc_training}, we show how 6B test performance varies over the course of 100 training epochs. We use test@N to denote the percentage of problems solved correctly at least once when allowing the model to make N separate guesses for each problem. We use a low temperature ($T=0$) to generate test@1 samples and we use a higher temperature ($T=0.7$) to generate test@100 samples. Both temperature values were chosen empirically to produce the best results. Test@1 performance improves approximately monotonically, even though we quickly begin overfitting on test loss. Unfortunately, test@100 performance degrades much more sharply than test@1 as we increase the number of epochs. This is to be expected: as the model repeatedly encounters the same data, it becomes increasingly uncalibrated and overconfident in its predictions. At test time, this overconfidence leads to poor coverage of the solution space, an effect which only becomes noticeable when we are considering multiple samples at test time.\n\nChoosing a model with good coverage is critical to successfully train verifiers. Empirically, we see that test@100 performance peaks within the first few epochs. For this reason, we use models trained for 2 epochs to generate samples for training verifiers. We provide several example solutions from 6B and 175B models in \\Cref{appendix:example_solutions}. We also note that it is important to allow the model to generate the full natural language solution before outputting a final answer. If we instead finetune a 6B model to directly output the final answer without any intermediate steps, performance drops drastically from 20.6\\% to 5.2\\%.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}{1.0 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/verifier_diagram.png}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{A diagram of the verification training pipeline.}\n\\label{fig:verifier_diagram}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Verification} \\label{section:verification}\n\nTo improve upon the finetuning baseline, we train verifiers to judge the correctness of model-generated solutions and search against these verifiers at test time. Conditioned on the problem and a candidate solution, the verifier outputs the probability that the solution is correct. Training solutions are labeled as correct or incorrect based solely on whether they reach the correct final answer. In practice, some solutions will reach the correct final answer using flawed reasoning, leading to false positives.\n\nAs shown in \\Cref{fig:verifier_diagram}, we train the verifier as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Finetune a model (the “generator”) for 2 epochs on the training set.\n\\item Sample 100 completions from the generator for each training problem and label each solution as correct or incorrect.\n\\item Train a verifier for a single epoch on this dataset.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nTraining for 2 epochs is enough for the generator to learn basic skills in this domain. We choose not to train for longer, since the diversity of generated solutions begins to collapse after this point, as shown in \\Cref{fig:bc_training}. We train separate generator and verifier models to limit the generator's training and prevent overfitting, but in principle, it should be possible to combine these models. Unless otherwise specified, we use the same model size for the generator and the verifier. In addition to predicting solution correctness, we also train the verifier with the same language modeling objective as the generator. This serves as a valuable auxiliary objective for the verifier. We discuss additional verifier training details in \\Cref{appendix:verifier_details}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}{0.475 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/full_completion_vf_6b.pdf}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\hspace*{\\fill}\n\\begin{subfigure}{0.475 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/full_completion_vf_175b.pdf}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{A comparison between finetuning and verification using 6B and 175B model sizes. Verification considers 100 solutions per problem. Mean and standard deviation is shown across 3 runs, except for 175B verification which shows only a single run.}\n\\label{fig:full_completion_vf}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAt test time, we sample 100 completions to each test problem, rank them with the verifier, and then return the one with the highest verifier score. A comparison between verification and finetuning is shown in \\Cref{fig:full_completion_vf} for both the 6B and 175B model sizes. We find that it is not beneficial to use verification at low dataset sizes. We believe this is due to the pressure to overfit to the correct answer: with small datasets, overfitting to the correct answer happens faster than learning more generalizable properties of correct reasoning. However, once we use a sufficiently large dataset, we see a strong boost from verifiers. It’s interesting to note that the 175B verifiers “take off” earlier than the 6B verifiers, requiring fewer training problems to surpass the finetuning baseline. See \\Cref{appendix:example_solutions} for example solutions found by verifiers and \\Cref{appendix:verifier_visualization} for a visualization of verifier confidence. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}{0.32 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fc_verifier_token_ablation.pdf}\n\\caption{Comparison between a verifier trained to predict correctness after every token (token-level) and one trained to predict correctness after only the final token (solution-level)} \\label{fig:fc_verifier_token_ablation}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\hspace*{\\fill}\n\\begin{subfigure}{0.32 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fc_verifier_loss_ablation.pdf}\n\\caption{Comparison between a verifier trained jointly to predict correctness and perform language modeling (joint) and one trained only to predict correctness (verification-only)} \\label{fig:fc_verifier_loss_ablation}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\hspace*{\\fill}\n\\begin{subfigure}{0.32 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/gen_vf_ablate_size.pdf}\n\\caption{Performance when varying the size of the generator and the verifier in isolation. Increasing the size of the generator has a larger impact than increasing the size of the verifier.} \\label{fig:gen_vf_ablate_size}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{Verification ablations}\n\\label{fig:fc_verifier_ablations}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Verification Ablations} \\label{section:verifier_ablations}\n\nWe can either train verifiers to make a single scalar prediction conditioned on the entire generated solution, or to make a scalar prediction after each token in the solution. By default, we choose the latter, training verifiers to make predictions after each token. This can be viewed as a token-level value function. We compare these two methods in \\Cref{fig:fc_verifier_token_ablation}, respectively labeled “solution-level” and “token-level”.\n\nPredicting the value function at every token is a more challenging and noisier task than judging only the full completion. However, despite the initially slower training, the token-level verifier ultimately outperforms the solution-level verifier. Moreover, the token-level verifier is still improving late in training, whereas the solution-level verifier quickly shows signs of overfitting. We hypothesize that the full value function provides a useful auxiliary signal that encourages the model to judge the reasoning throughout solutions, rather than merely memorizing the correct final answer. \n\nIn \\Cref{fig:fc_verifier_loss_ablation}, we ablate the objective used when training verifiers. As discussed in \\Cref{section:verification}, we can optionally include a language modeling objective alongside the verification objective. We compare using both objectives to using only the verification objective. Although both are reasonable choices, including the language modeling objective is a strict improvement. This makes intuitive sense: better understanding this language distribution should only aid the verifier in discriminating between samples.\n\nIn \\Cref{fig:gen_vf_ablate_size}, we separately ablate the model size of the generator and the verifier. We find that using a large generator with a small verifier performs significantly better than using a small generator with a large verifier. Verification is still remarkably effective, even when the verifier is much smaller than the generator. This suggests that the verifier may often be relying on relatively coarse heuristics to discriminate between solutions from a given generator, rather than attempting a more thorough form of verification.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}{0.475 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/completions.pdf}\n\\caption{6B verification test performance when given varying numbers of completions per problem to rank.} \\label{fig:completions}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\hspace*{\\fill}\n\\begin{subfigure}{0.475 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/vote.pdf}\n\\caption{6B verification test performance when varying the number of top ranked samples allowed to vote on the answer.} \\label{fig:vote}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{Performance as the amount of test time compute varies.}\n\\label{fig:test_time_compute_trends}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Additional Experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Test Time Compute}\n\nAt test time, we can choose to generate arbitrarily many solutions to be judged by the verifier before selecting the highest ranked completion. \\Cref{fig:completions} shows how 6B verifier performance varies with the number of completions per test problem. At this scale, performance improves as we increase the number of completions up to 400. Beyond this point, performance start to decrease. This suggests that the benefits of search are eventually outweighed by the risk of finding adversarial solutions that fool the verifier. In general, we evaluate verifier test performance using 100 completions, since this captures most of the benefits of verification with a relatively modest compute cost.\n\nTo further increase performance, we can take a majority vote among the top verifier-ranked solutions instead of selecting only the single top solution. This voting process considers only the final answer reached by the individual solutions: the final answer selected is the one with the most votes. \\Cref{fig:vote} shows how performance varies as we allow a greater number of top samples to cast a vote. Unsurprisingly, when starting with a greater number of samples, we can afford to allow a greater number of samples to cast a vote. When we have only 100 samples, it is optimal to allow only the top 3-5 samples to cast a vote. When we have 3200 samples, it is approximately optimal to allow the top 30 to cast a vote.\n\n\\subsection{Regularization}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}{0.32 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/bc_dropout.pdf}\n\\caption{Finetuning} \\label{fig:bc_dropout}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\hspace*{\\fill}\n\\begin{subfigure}{0.32 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/single_token_dropout.pdf}\n\\caption{Solution-level verifiers} \\label{fig:single_token_dropout}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\hspace*{\\fill}\n\\begin{subfigure}{0.32 \\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/all_token_dropout.pdf}\n\\caption{Token-level verifiers} \\label{fig:all_token_dropout}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{6B finetuning and verification dropout ablations.}\n\\label{fig:dropout_ablations}\n\\end{figure}\n\n We find that both finetuning and verification strongly benefit from the use of dropout as a regularizer. Specifically, we apply residual dropout \\citep{vaswani2017attention} along the residual paths of each layer in the network. We use 20\\% dropout for all dropout experiments, chosen based on the results of a hyperparameters sweep. We note that GPT-3 models are not pretrained with dropout. For experiments involving dropout, we therefore perform additional pretraining with dropout before subsequently finetuning the models. This mitigates the distribution shift the model experiences during finetuning.\n\n We first investigate the effect of dropout on finetuning across various training set sizes. \\Cref{fig:bc_dropout} shows that dropout leads to a significant improvement over baseline. We next investigate the effect of dropout on verifiers, considering both the solution-level and token-level variants. In \\Cref{fig:single_token_dropout}, we see that dropout significantly improves solution-level verifiers, mitigating the overfitting that occurs in the unregularized baseline. Notably, using dropout with solution-level verifiers reaches a similar level of performance as token-level verifiers. In \\Cref{fig:all_token_dropout}, we apply dropout to token-level verifiers. Since token-level verifiers are already less susceptible to overfitting, it is no surprise that the impact of dropout is less significant. Nevertheless, we do still see a slight gain from training token-level verifiers with dropout. Note that we increase the batch size for token-level verifiers by a factor of 4, to better handle the more difficult objective and the noise from dropout.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe have seen that verification provides a significant performance boost relative to a finetuning baseline. On the full dataset, 6B verification slightly outperforms a finetuned 175B model, thereby offering a boost approximately equivalent to a 30x model size increase. We have also seen that token-level verifiers are less prone to overfitting than solution-level verifiers, and that all methods benefit from regularization with residual dropout. We expect verification to scale well to problem distributions that require more complex mathematical reasoning, and we hope GSM8K supports the development of new methods that scale even better.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nWe thank Dan Hendrycks, Leo Gao, Alec Radford, and Giambattista Parascandolo for their valuable feedback on this paper; Harri Edwards, Yura Burda, Michael Wu, and Nick Ryder for many insightful conversations; Michael Petrov, Alethea Power, and Jacob Jackson for their technical assistance; the OpenAI Supercomputing team for the infrastructure that made these experiments possible; and the team at Surge AI for performing the GSM8K data collection.\n\n\\changeurlcolor{black}\n\n\\changeurlcolor{blue}\n\n\\end{document}\n</paper 3>\n\nYour summary should follow these steps:\n- Title: Clearly state the main subject or topic of the summary.\n- Introduction: Describe the field and briefly introduce its history.

However, these models still struggle with tasks that require multi-step mathematical reasoning and the ability to generate detailed, coherent explanations for their solutions. This challenge is particularly evident in the domain of algebraic word problems, where models must translate natural language descriptions into mathematical expressions and solve these expressions to derive a final answer. The task is further complicated by the requirement to generate a rationale, a natural language explanation of the solution process, which adds a layer of interpretability and reasoning to the model's output. This summary explores three recent papers that tackle this challenge from different angles, focusing on the generation of rationales, the induction of arithmetic programs, and the verification of generated solutions.\n\nThe history of solving algebraic word problems with NLP models dates back to the early 2010s, with researchers proposing various methods to translate natural language into mathematical expressions and solve them. Initial approaches involved learning to fill in templates that could be solved by equation solvers, or inferring and modeling operation sequences (programs) that lead to the final answer. However, these methods often failed to generate comprehensive explanations or rationales that justify the steps taken to solve the problem. The recent surge in the development of large language models has brought new possibilities and challenges to this domain, as these models must now not only solve problems but also provide detailed, human-readable explanations of their reasoning.\n\nCurrent progress in this field involves the use of sequence-to-sequence models and specialized architectures designed to handle the complexity of algebraic word problems. However, the challenge remains in ensuring that these models can generate accurate solutions and coherent rationales, especially for problems that require multi-step reasoning and a diverse range of mathematical operations. The papers discussed in this summary present innovative approaches to address these challenges, each contributing to the broader goal of creating models that can solve and explain algebraic word problems effectively.\n\n### Main Content of Each Paper\n\n#### Paper 1: Program Induction by Rationale Generation: Learning to Solve and Explain Algebraic Word Problems\nThis paper introduces a novel strategy for solving algebraic word problems by generating answer rationales, which are sequences of natural language and mathematical expressions that justify the final answer. The authors propose a model that can generate both the rationale and the answer, leveraging a dataset of over 100,000 algebraic word problems, each annotated with an answer and a rationale. The model is trained to predict a sequence of program instructions that, when executed, generate the rationale and ultimately the answer. The program instructions include operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more complex operations like factorials and combinations. The authors also introduce a heuristic search method to guide the generation of these instructions, ensuring that the model can generate plausible next steps in the rationale.\n\nThe dataset used in this paper, known as AQuA, is meticulously constructed to cover a broad range of topics and difficulty levels. It includes problems from exams like the GMAT and GRE, ensuring that the problems are diverse and challenging. The authors highlight that the search space for generating the rationale is large, and they use a sequence-to-sequence model to generate the instructions that form the rationale. The model is trained to maximize the probability of generating a sequence of instructions that can produce the correct rationale and answer, using staged backpropagation to handle the large size of the program instructions.\n\n#### Paper 2: Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding\nThis paper presents a new benchmark for assessing the multitask language understanding capabilities of models, focusing on a diverse set of subjects including the humanities, social sciences, STEM, and other specialized fields. The benchmark consists of multiple-choice questions from various domains, such as law, medicine, psychology, and mathematics. The authors evaluate models like GPT-3 and UnifiedQA in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, demonstrating that while larger models like GPT-3 can achieve non-random accuracy, they still struggle with tasks that require procedural knowledge and calculation-heavy problems. The dataset used in this paper, known as Massive Multitask, is designed to measure the breadth and depth of a model's understanding, covering 57 different tasks at varying levels of difficulty.\n\nThe authors find that the performance of models is lopsided, with some subjects like marketing achieving high accuracy (around 82.5\\%) and others like college chemistry performing poorly (around 26\\%). They also note that models are uncalibrated, meaning their confidence in predictions does not accurately reflect the probability of correctness. The authors suggest that future models must learn more during pretraining to improve their performance on these tasks, emphasizing the need for models to acquire knowledge in a more human-like manner, primarily through reading diverse text rather than relying on specialized training sets.\n\n#### Paper 3: Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems\nThis paper introduces GSM8K, a dataset of 8.5K grade school math word problems, designed to probe the informal reasoning ability of large language models. The authors propose a method to improve model performance by training verifiers to judge the correctness of model-generated solutions. At test time, the model generates multiple candidate solutions, and the verifier ranks these solutions, selecting the one with the highest score. The authors find that verification significantly improves performance on GSM8K, especially when the verifier is trained to make predictions after each token in the solution rather than just at the end. They also show that verification scales more favorably with increased data compared to finetuning, and that using dropout as a regularizer further enhances performance.\n\nThe GSM8K dataset is curated to ensure high quality and diversity, with problems requiring between 2 and 8 steps to solve. Solutions are provided in natural language, allowing the model to develop verbal analytical skills and produce more interpretable solutions. The authors use models from the GPT-3 family as their initialization, finetuning them for 2 epochs to generate solutions and then training verifiers for a single epoch to evaluate these solutions. They find that verification provides a significant performance boost, especially for larger datasets, and that the benefits of verification are maintained even when the verifier is much smaller than the generator.\n\n### Commonalities and Innovations\nAll three papers address the challenge of solving and explaining algebraic word problems, but they do so through different methodologies and datasets. The common thread among these papers is the recognition that solving these problems requires not only the ability to perform arithmetic operations but also to generate coherent explanations that justify the solution process. The authors of each paper emphasize the importance of generating natural language rationales, which can provide insights into the model's reasoning and help improve its problem-solving capabilities.\n\n**Commonalities:**\n- **Dataset Construction:** Each paper uses a carefully curated dataset to train and evaluate their models. The datasets cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, ensuring that the models are tested on a diverse set of problems.\n- **Program Induction:** The first paper and the third paper both use program induction as a key component of their models. The first paper generates a sequence of program instructions that form the rationale, while the third paper generates solutions and then uses a verifier to rank them.\n- **Evaluation Metrics:** All papers evaluate their models using accuracy metrics, but the first paper also uses perplexity and BLEU scores to assess the quality of the generated rationales.\n\n**Innovations:**\n- **Rationale Generation:** The first paper introduces a new task of generating answer rationales as part of the solution process, which is a more faithful representation of the steps used in computing the answer. This approach enhances model interpretability and provides a coarse guide to the structure of the arithmetic programs.\n- **Massive Multitask Benchmark:** The second paper proposes a new benchmark that measures how well text models can learn and apply knowledge encountered during pretraining. This benchmark covers 57 different subjects, ranging from elementary mathematics to professional law, and highlights the limitations of current models in handling tasks that require procedural knowledge and calculation-heavy problems.\n- **Verifier Training:** The third paper introduces the concept of training verifiers to evaluate the correctness of model-generated solutions. This method leverages the inherent optionality of verification and the simplicity of the verification task compared to the generation task, leading to more robust solutions.\n\n### Comparison of Results and Discussion\nThe results from the three papers highlight the current limitations of large language models in solving and explaining algebraic word problems. The first paper demonstrates that state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models struggle to perform above chance on this task, but their proposed model doubles the accuracy of the baseline. The second paper shows that even the largest GPT-3 model has near-random accuracy on calculation-heavy STEM subjects and socially relevant subjects like law and morality, indicating significant room for improvement. The third paper finds that verification significantly improves performance on GSM8K, providing a boost equivalent to a 30x model size increase.\n\n**Table 1: Comparison of Model Performance on Algebraic Word Problems**\n\n| Model Type | Dataset | Accuracy (%) | BLEU Score | Perplexity |\n|------------|---------|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Seq2Seq     | AQuA    | 20.8         | 8.57       | 524.7      |\n| UnifiedQA   | Massive Multitask | 48.9       | -          | -          |\n| GPT-3 (few-shot) | Massive Multitask | 43.9       | -          | -          |\n| Verifier (token-level) | GSM8K        | 42.2       | -          | -          |\n| Verifier (solution-level) | GSM8K        | 38.6       | -          | -          |\n\nThe first paper's model achieves an accuracy of 36.4\\% on the AQuA dataset, significantly outperforming the baseline models. The second paper's results show that GPT-3 has near-random accuracy on calculation-heavy STEM subjects, indicating that current models struggle with tasks that require procedural knowledge and detailed reasoning. The third paper's verification method improves the performance of the 6B model to 42.2\\%, which is comparable to the performance of the 175B model without verification.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe three papers discussed in this summary contribute significantly to the field of solving and explaining algebraic word problems. They highlight the importance of generating natural language rationales, which can provide insights into the model's reasoning process and improve its problem-solving capabilities. The authors of each paper emphasize the need for models to acquire knowledge in a more human-like manner, primarily through reading diverse text rather than relying on specialized training sets.\n\nThe first paper introduces a new task of generating answer rationales as part of the solution process, which enhances model interpretability and provides a coarse guide to the structure of the arithmetic programs. The second paper proposes a new benchmark that measures how well text models can learn and apply knowledge encountered during pretraining, covering a wide range of subjects and difficulty levels. The third paper introduces the concept of training verifiers to evaluate the correctness of model-generated solutions, which leverages the inherent optionality of verification and the simplicity of the verification task compared to the generation task.\n\nThe results from these papers indicate that while significant progress has been made, there is still a long way to go in creating models that can robustly solve and explain algebraic word problems. Future research should focus on developing more effective methods for program induction and verification, as well as improving the calibration of models to ensure that their confidence in predictions accurately reflects the probability of correctness. Additionally, future work should explore the integration of multimodal information to support more comprehensive understanding and reasoning, as current models are primarily trained on text data and struggle with tasks that require a deeper understanding of specialized subjects like law and morality.\n\n### Future Research Directions\n- **Enhancing Program Induction:** Future research should aim to improve the program induction process, making it more robust and capable of handling a wider range of mathematical operations and problem types.\n- **Multimodal Understanding:** As models become more capable of processing multimodal inputs, future benchmarks should reflect this change, incorporating tasks that require models to interact with flexible formats and demonstrate multimodal understanding.\n- **Calibration and Interpretability:** Research should focus on improving the calibration of models to ensure that their confidence in predictions accurately reflects the probability of correctness. Additionally, models should be designed to produce more interpretable solutions, which can help researchers understand the reasoning process and identify areas for improvement.\n- **Specialized Training Data:** While models are primarily trained on text data, future work should explore the use of specialized training data to improve performance on tasks that require procedural knowledge and detailed reasoning, such as calculation-heavy STEM subjects and socially relevant subjects like law and morality.\n\nIn summary, these papers demonstrate the potential of using program induction and verification to improve the performance of models on algebraic word problems. They also highlight the importance of generating natural language rationales and the need for models to acquire knowledge in a more human-like manner. Future research should build on these findings to create more robust and interpretable models that can solve and explain a wide range of algebraic word problems."
